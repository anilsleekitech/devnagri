        "<h2 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-4\">About Client</h2>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">A reputed government tech institute in India, well-known for its digital-first approach to education. Their digital learning content has grown rapidly in recent years</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Challenge</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">The institute has students from rural and semi-urban regions, many of whom were more comfortable learning in their mother tongue. So the challenge was to make their existing video lessons work in multiple Indian languages without starting from scratch.<br />We discussed over 120 hours of video lectures, tutorials, explainers, and walkthroughs. Some were simple talking-head formats, but others had synced slides, on-screen elements, and interactive segments.<br />Voice-overs for all the subtitles, synced perfectly, with accurate technical vocabulary, delivered in a tight window. Plus, the final output needed to slot neatly into their LMS (Learning Management System) without breaking any tracking or completion data.</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Solution</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We ran the original English videos through our transcription engine. The tool’s trained on Indian accents for solid accuracy. Time-stamped scripts made syncing easier down the line.<br />So we used our AI-powered machine translation API models fine-tuned for Indian education content, and for the perfection of the sensitive or technical bits.<br />For voice-overs, we used a mix of synthetic voices and professional artists. We matched voices to the subject matter so the tone didn’t feel robotic or out of place.<br />We reassembled everything, syncing the voice tracks, adjusting timing, and adding multilingual subtitles. After internal QA, we packaged it all into LMS-ready formats (SCORM, xAPI, etc.) so it could be uploaded without needing developer time.</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Key Features</h3>",
        "<ul><li>Custom Language Models trained on domain-specific content</li><li>Smart voice tech that adjusted pitch and tone based on context</li><li>Manual QA passes at critical points, especially on terminology.</li><li>Non-intrusive integration into the client’s LMS without rework</li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">End-to-end encryption and secure data handling throughout</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Impact</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We reduced the average localization time per video from nearly 3 hours to under 40 minutes.</p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Here’s what changed:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Faster delivery: Everything went live in under 9 weeks</li><li>Cost savings: Estimated 70–75% lower cost than traditional voice-over studios</li><li>Student response: Modules in regional languages saw up to 62% more completions compared to English-only versions</li><li>No tech hiccups: The team dropped the new content into the LMS with zero disruption</li><li>Scalability: The institute expanded the project to three more departments afterwards</li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We’ve brought together speed, accuracy, and cultural nuance. If you’re trying to scale content for multiple Indian languages while keeping things fast and cost-effective, we’re here to help.</p>"

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We promptly recognized the immediate gaps. All customer-facing materials — brochures, product manuals, and digital advertisements —were only in English. A strong interest in the market for their product did not build customer understanding and trust among the non-English-speaking part of the territory.</p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">This translated into quite a few complications:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Regional customers had some difficulties grasping the product features and were hesitant about their purchase decision.</li><li>The sales and support teams were bombarded with basic and repetitive queries that could have been avoided if only better education material had been provided</li><li>Onboarding customers to the regional market took a long time, and miscommunication about technical documentation often escalated into service issues.</li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">As a result, despite growing interest in non-metro markets, conversion rates remained low.</p>",

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">The direct and visible impact of our multilingual collateral solution is as follows:</p>",
        "<ul><li>Engagements from the regional side spiked, with inquiries from non-metro customers increasing by 40% in the first quarter after going live.</li><li>Sales agents also reported a 30% reduction in onboarding time, as the materials were handed to customers immediately.</li><li>Customer understanding increased significantly, leading to a 25% decrease in service escalation tickets from the regional market.</li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Support call volume for basic product-related queries decreased, freeing up bandwidth for customer-facing staff to focus on more value-added interactions.</p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Conversion rates increased 18% in tier 2 and 3 cities, confirming that speaking your customers’ language is not just good but also the right thing to do.</p>"

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In plain terms, a </span><b>translation API</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a tool that helps you automatically convert your content from one language to another.

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially if you are serious about Indian language translation, a good translation API should have the following:</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">1. Coverage of Languages</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should not only be Hindi but also many other Indian languages. Assamese, Odia, Kannada, and others all need help for real inclusiveness.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">2. Compatibility of Scripts</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indian scripts such as Eastern Nagari (used for Assamese) have to be reproduced properly across devices and browsers. Your API has to handle this seamlessly.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">3. Contextual Correctness</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot depend on direct word-for-word translation. The engine has to grasp the language, tone, and context. For instance, depending on who you are speaking to, Assamese has varied honorifics and verb forms.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">4. Scalability</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The API should manage both without performance concerns, whether your eCommerce site has 20,000 items or your blog has 200 posts.</span></p>",

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The API should provide adaptable SDKs or webhooks that fit with the least effort, whether your site is built on WordPress, a mobile app, or a React frontend.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">6. Human-in-the-loop option Choice</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though occasionally for legal, financial, or medical material, you will require human translators, AI does the majority. The API ought to enable this fallback system.</span></p>",

Imagine a government website providing public service information in Assamese right now. Alternatively, a single API would power an e-learning system with localised course content, exams, and alerts.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not about checking off boxes. It's about providing folks access to knowledge in a language they really grasp.</span></p>",

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about a banking system. Any language makes financial terminology difficult to grasp. But, providing information in Assamese, or any local language, can significantly change things. Customers find it simpler to read and believe loan terms, KYC papers, and FAQs.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span><b> translation API </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allows this material to be localized in real time across online, mobile, SMS, and email platforms, so guaranteeing your Assamese-speaking consumer the same experience as an English-speaking one.</span></p>",

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engines should not be forgotten. Translating material increases your presence in local search results as local-language queries increase. A translated FAQ, product page, or blog article could perform better in Assamese search queries, generating natural traffic you would not otherwise reach.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Final Words</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building digital experiences for India means neglecting indigenous languages is no longer an option. A strong website </span><b>translation API</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to localize at scale—across platforms, in real time, and with accuracy.</span></p>",

      "content": [
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization is adapting your product to meet various linguistic, cultural, and functional needs. In today's globally connected digital culture, businesses can no longer stop at having applications or product content in a single language. Users, even from different parts of the world, expected a product and service to have the required thing speaking their language-literally and culturally. And that's where localization comes in.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This offers a bit of technical and creative drama for developers. In this blog, we unravel nine major localization troubles faced by developers and how they can solve these issues, while also providing real-world examples from industries such as eLearning translation solutions, finance, and cross-country markets, including</span> <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-odia-translation/\"><b>English to Odia translation</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>",
        "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/devnagri-website-data/uploads/2025/04/4883bc8d-expansion-contraction-of-texts.png\" alt=\"Expansion-Contraction of Texts\" class=\"img-fluid\">",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">1. Expansion-Contraction of Texts</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the translation process, there is a drastic variation in text length compared to the original text. For instance, \"Log In\" in English might take up much more space in the Odiya version. This creates layout issues, especially on mobile or responsive designs.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Dynamic, flexible layouts can accommodate text expansion. CSS relative units and auto-layout tools in design software can help. There must be an earlier test of the UI with real translations early in the process for developers who work on projects targeting regional audiences, like apps that offer English to Odia translation. </span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">2. Font and Script Compatibility.</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fonts don't support all languages or even scripts. Indian language translations, such as Odia, have unique ligatures and characters that can appear broken or unreadable if you use a font that doesn't support them.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Choose a Unicode-compliant font that has full script support. Fonts like Noto Sans Odia or Lohit Odia are good options to consider when working with projects like English to Odia translation. It's always prudent to test how fonts render on different browsers and devices to avoid display issues.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">3. Date, Time, and Number Format</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each region has its conventions regarding how dates, times, and amounts in currencies are represented. For example, 01/05/2025 could refer to May 1st in one country and January 5th in another. This is especially sensitive in industries like banking and finance.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Localization libraries such as </span><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/moment-js-moment-day-method/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moment.js</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the built-in Intl API would be appropriate handles to address these differences. Correctly formatting the amount and date of transactions for banking and finance applications builds user trust and ensures regulatory compliance.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">4. Managing Dynamic and User-Generated Content</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Media channels often respect user-generated content and live updates that are not pre-translated. This can be exceedingly challenging for publishing media, where content must be available instantly for a multilingual audience.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Go for a real-time translation management system that features API integration. This allows the smooth management of dynamic content while keeping localization seamless. For example, a media publishing platform that targets regional markets can provide real-time English to Odia translation for breaking news, thus keeping the audience wrapped in their native language.</span></p>",
        "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/devnagri-website-data/uploads/2025/04/4185cd24-sensitivity-with-culture-and-context.png\" alt=\"Sensitivity With Culture and Context\" class=\"img-fluid\">",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">5. Sensitivity With Culture and Context</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization is not simply language. It is culture. Colors, symbols, images, and even humor can mean different things in different cultures. When it comes to e-learning applications, inappropriate cultural references can alienate learners.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Engage local linguists and cultural experts in content adaptation to ensure it is contextually relevant. While avoiding idioms or cultural references that won't translate, e-learning platforms, especially, need culturally relevant examples to sustain students' interest and understanding. </span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">6. Inconsistent Terminology in Specializations</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The banking and finance industries should use precise and standardized terminology. Otherwise, an inconsistent translation of financial terms may cause customer confusion or even lead to legal entanglements.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Make a glossary of approved terms and ensure consistent use of these terms in the translation of all content. This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation in legal documents, contracts, and app interfaces by consistently applying </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/banking-finance-translation/\"><b>banking and finance translation</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solutions.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">7. Integration with Localization Tools</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization in many development pipelines is not optimized. Without good integration of translation workflows, developers often experience delays and errors during multilingual deployments.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Use translation management systems with strong APIs and plug-ins to connect with your code repository and content management system. Continuous localization tools will keep everything up to date automatically, whether you're dealing with a finance app, an e-learning portal, or a media publishing solution.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">8. Testing in Multiple Languages and Regions</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localized applications often encounter functional and visual problems, such as broken layouts, cut-off text, or untranslated strings, when released for different languages.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Build an internationalization (i18n) testing environment and introduce pseudo-localization — a technique whereby testing substitutes text strings with exaggerated characters — to find layout problems even before real translation happens. Important for languages like Odia that stimulate complex scripts.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"f-20 f-600 text-black mb-3\">9. Complex and Right-to-Left Scripts into Account</h4>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the globalized world today, languages with complex writing systems, such as Arabic, Urdu, or Odia, present added technical difficulties for developers. Though one might argue that Odia has a left-to-right writing direction, the entire process requires specialized handling.</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: Design the app with bidirectional and multilingual functionality in mind from the start, using complex typography-supported frameworks and libraries. Apply early testing with real translations, keeping in mind the geographic area of intended users, such as India and Odia. </span></p>",
        "<h5 class=\"f-18 f-600 text-black mb-3\">In localization, every industry matters:</h5>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Conclusion</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization is not just a technical activity. It is a strategic necessity for organizations that intend to prosper in regional, national, and international markets. Whether you're building e-learning platforms, financial apps, media publishing solutions, or tools, localization will save time, money, and customer dissatisfaction in the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization will save time, money, and customer dissatisfaction in the long run when localized issues are addressed upfront. Product design with localization built in, the selection of tools, and engagement with native language experts will ensure that the product feels natural and familiar at every point of contact.</span></p>"

        "<h6>Banks have embedded Gen-AI in their operations, and it\u2019s now a co-pilot in decision-making across the board, but it\u2019s still far from replacing your<b> friendly banker</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has your loan application been rejected? Do you feel upset about it? What can be more upsetting is that it wasn\u2019t a human but a machine that aided that decision.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, generative-AI provides rich data sets that enable the \u2018human in the loop\u2019 \u2013 the bank officer \u2013 to approve or reject your loan. Welcome to the era of AI-driven banking.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks in India today are steadily embedding generative AI (Gen-AI) into their operations \u2014 from chatbots and fraud detection to customer onboarding and even loan origination. Gen-AI is also behind those personalised messages you now receive via email or WhatsApp, tailored using your past behaviour and spending history.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, like text, images, and videos, rather than analysing or classifying existing data.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface,\u201d said Deepak Sharma, CXO advisor and entrepreneur. \u201cAI is fast becoming the co-pilot in decision-making across many parts of banking. It isn\u2019t replacing humans. It\u2019s amplifying their ability to serve.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharma, who now sits on the boards of Experian India, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and was the former chief digital officer at Kotak Mahindra Bank, told </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Federal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Gen-AI is driving change in both front-end engagement and back-end efficiency.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe most valuable use cases right now are in customer acquisition, retention, and cross-selling of financial products like mutual funds or insurance. Over time, I see it extending to product design, market prediction, and even real-time policy adaptation,\u201d he said.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there\u2019s a caveat. While banks are eager to embrace Gen-AI, fintech partners and tech advisors caution that in India \u2014 a heavily regulated market \u2014 Gen-AI is yet to find a place in \u201ccore banking functions\u201d like payments and reconciliations. Most deployments today focus on enhancing the periphery, not the engine.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Banking on bots</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kishan Sundar, CTO at Maveric Systems \u2014 which works with banks globally on AI integration \u2014 the most immediate impact has been on \u201crisk management, customer engagement, and automation\u201d.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take fraud detection, for instance. AI tools developed by Maveric scan enormous volumes of transactional data to identify unusual patterns \u2014 a sudden flurry of logins from different locations, or microtransactions meant to test stolen cards.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe scale and speed at which AI can surface red flags is far beyond traditional rule-based systems,\u201d Sundar explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about spotting fraud after the fact \u2014 it\u2019s about preventing it in real time.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Diagnostic assistant</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another area gaining traction is incident management \u2014 a vital but often invisible part of customer experience. Maveric\u2019s AI models help banks trace the root cause of system outages or failed transactions, enabling faster resolution and less customer frustration.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThink of it as a diagnostic assistant that sees across systems and suggests fixes before an issue escalates,\u201d Sundar pointed out. But one of the most powerful use cases lies in customer segmentation and targetted marketing \u2014 something generative AI is now making dynamic and real-time.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By analysing a blend of personal financial behaviour, spending patterns, and digital interaction data, AI can cluster customers far more precisely than conventional segmentation. \u201cInstead of treating 10,000 customers as one group, you can have 10,000 micro-strategies,\u201d said Sundar.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks can now tailor offers \u2014 from insurance to savings products \u2014 based on predicted customer behaviour, not just demographics.</span></p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For fin-tech startups like Devnagri, gen-AI is solving a completely different problem: language.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2019, Devnagri uses a proprietary NLP model to translate and contextualise content across 22 Indian languages \u2014 with banking being one of its biggest sectors. Their clients include several India\u2019s top banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCore banking is sacrosanct. While AI can translate a loan document, it cannot currently approve one. It can remind you about an EMI, but it cannot evaluate whether your credit profile justifies one.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLanguage is a big unlock for BFSI,\u201d Nakul Kundra, CEO and co-founder, told </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Federal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cBanks want to reach the next 500 million users. But those customers speak in their native tongue \u2014 not English. And when it comes to banking, context is everything.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dDevnagri\u2019s Gen-AI engine doesn\u2019t just translate. It interprets. For example, it understands that the word \u2018home\u2019 (ghar in Hindi) could mean a literal house \u2014 but the Union Home Minister is not ghar ka minister right? Similarly, \u2018watch\u2019 could mean a wristwatch or surveillance.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe built domain-specific models so the AI knows whether it\u2019s handling BFSI content or a political speech,\u201d Kundra explained. The company also enables real-time chat and voice bots for banks \u2014 many of which are integrated into websites and call centers. These bots are trained to handle up to 40 per cent of routine queries in local languages before escalating complex issues to human agents.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAnd because Gen-AI can detect tone and emotion, it can also express empathy,\u201d Kundra said. \u201cIf a customer is angry or grieving, the bot won\u2019t reply with a generic message. It can respond with sensitivity.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Red lines and firewalls</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, for all its promise, there are boundaries to where AI is allowed to operate \u2014 especially in India.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCore banking is sacrosanct,\u201d Kundra said. \u201cRBI regulations prohibit third-party Gen-AI systems from touching real-time banking data \u2014 whether it\u2019s credit scoring, payment reconciliation, or KYC approval.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dThis means that while AI can translate a loan document, it cannot currently approve one. It can remind you about an EMI, but it cannot evaluate whether your credit profile justifies one,\u201d he added.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Sharma believed this will evolve. \u201cIn countries like Singapore, regulators are far more flexible. India will get there, but we\u2019ll take a cautious path \u2014 rightly so, given the sensitivity of financial data,\u201d he said.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Policing the prompt</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Sharma and Kundra emphasise the importance of guardrails when deploying Gen-AI in banking. Left unchecked, AI can go rogue \u2014 offering unsolicited advice or interpreting sarcasm as fact.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundra shared an anecdote. \u201cDuring testing, someone jokingly asked the bot who would win the India-Pakistan match. The bot politely refused to answer, reminding the user that its purpose was to assist with banking queries,\u201d he said. In another case, a bot offered a link to a job portal when a user said they had lost their job.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne day, AI audits may become mandatory \u2014 much like the financial and IT audits banks undergo today.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat could\u2019ve backfired. So we introduced boundaries \u2014 predefined responses when the AI detects sarcasm, jokes, or out-of-scope questions.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In customer service, these nuances matter, he said. \u201cIf a person calls the bank and says, \u2018my husband died, and I don\u2019t know what to do about the home loan\u2019, the AI needs to escalate that immediately to a human,\u201d he explained. \u201cEmpathy can\u2019t be optional.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Internal intel</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly, Gen-AI is also finding a role in \u201cinternal knowledge management\u201d.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharma shared how, during his time at Kotak, they used AI to help employees stay updated with RBI circulars, compliance checklists, and internal product policies. \u201cIt became like a ready reckoner,\u201d he admitted.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith RBI releasing updates almost every day, no one could possibly keep up. So AI made that accessible. Devnagri is also exploring this space. Several of its clients now use AI to train new staff, ensure compliance, and even assist in employee certification exams. With global partnerships like those Maveric has with Databricks, and startups like Devnagri gaining traction in multi-lingual automation, the future of Gen-AI in Indian banking looks expansive \u2014 albeit tightly regulated.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Assistive to predictive</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharma is optimistic. \u201cAI will increasingly move from assistive to predictive. It\u2019ll tell you what the customer wants before they know it. It\u2019ll help banks become proactive, not reactive.\u201d</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, he cautions that trust will be key. \u201cNo AI should ever deny a loan or freeze an account without a clear explanation and a human override. Transparency, explainability, and ethics \u2014 those are non-negotiable,\u201d Sharma added.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believed the day isn\u2019t far when AI audits will become mandatory \u2014 much like the financial and IT audits banks undergo today.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Gen-AI may not be running the bank. But it\u2019s certainly becoming its smartest assistant.</span></p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Localization is crucial to a global business strategy in an\n                    increasingly interconnected world. It involves modifying\n                    content, products, or services to align with a specific\n                    target locale’s linguistic, cultural, and functional needs.\n                    Localization goes beyond mere translation; it ensures that\n                    your brand feels authentically local to users around the\n                    globe </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, modern localization also has challenges in\n                    linguistic aspects, and cultural nuances must be maintained\n                    while multilingual solutions are almost always technically\n                    implemented across platforms. This implies that the language\n                    choice of the business dictates just how much respect will\n                    be given to the localization process. At the same time,\n                    scalability and integration into current workflows must also\n                    be addressed. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When considering localization tools, our criteria include\n                    flexibility across languages (</span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-assamese-translation/\"><b>English to Assamese Translation</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, for example), AI-driven accuracy, automation potential,\n                    and seamless integration into development pipelines. In this\n                    article, we introduce six powerful tools and platforms to\n                    help businesses of all sizes achieve high-quality\n                    multilingual localization.\n                  </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TMSs are essential for coordinating complex localization\n                    projects. These platforms offer workflow automation,\n                    centralized terminology management, and collaborative\n                    features to ease localization.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Use Cases: TMS platforms are beneficial for enterprises\n                    managing high volumes of content, marketing teams ensuring\n                    brand voice consistency across multiple authors, and\n                    developers working in CI/CD environments.\n                  </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Businesses can speed up their time to market dramatically\n                    while ensuring correct cultural and linguistic accuracy by\n                    using a combination of tools: using OCR to scan documents,\n                    AI machine translation for first drafts, and a TMS for\n                    workflow management. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For a startup trying out new markets or an enterprise with\n                    42+ languages to manage, one needs to set the best course in\n                    localization to use a mix of the right tools that meet\n                    content needs, technical stack, and scalability objectives.\n                    In the future, localization will offer an era of\n                    intelligent, efficient, and culturally aware global\n                    communication: AI and automation will continue to\n                    evolve.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<b>Vowels and Consonants:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    There are 35 consonants (Vianjan) and 10 vowels (Laga Matra)\n                    in Gurmukhi. Therefore, the pronunciation and writing are\n                    not similar to those of English.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Writing Direction:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    Like English, Gurmukhi is written from Left to Right, unlike\n                    some other scripts that are written from right, as in\n                    Arabic.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Non-Capitalisation:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    There are no concepts of capitalisation and small letters in\n                    Punjabi, unlike English.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Basic knowledge of the script would be handy before\n                    translating English to Punjabi.\n                  </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many differences in grammar between Punjabi and\n                    English. Some significant differences are:</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phrase Order: Subject-object-verb (SOV) is used for\n                    Punjabi, in contrast with subject-verb-object (SVO) in\n                    English.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Example</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: \u201cI eat an apple.\u201d (English) \u2192 \u201c\u0a2e\u0a48\u0a02 \u0a38\u0a47\u0a2c \u0a16\u0a3e\u0a02\u0a26\u0a3e \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a02\u201d\n                    (Punjabi) \u2192 \u201cMain seb khanda haan.\u201d</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Agreement with Gender: Based on gender, the nouns and verbs\n                    change in Punjabi.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Example:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    \u201cHe is reading.\u201d \u2192 \u201c\u0a09\u0a39 \u0a2a\u0a5c\u0a4d\u0a39 \u0a30\u0a3f\u0a39\u0a3e \u0a39\u0a48\u201d (for male) / \u201c\u0a09\u0a39 \u0a2a\u0a5c\u0a4d\u0a39\n                    \u0a30\u0a39\u0a40 \u0a39\u0a48\u201d (for female)</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Extensive Tense Variations: The language has multiple tense\n                    forms for each verb, unlike English, which has a few forms\n                    for each verb.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several tools can help a person translate English to\n                    Punjabi. An example is Google Translate, which has an\n                    exciting feature for basic translation, but in complicated\n                    sentences, the translation can become significantly\n                    inaccurate.</span>\n</p>",

Will you emphasize your existing\n                    customers, potential growth markets, or markets speaking\n                    languages with the highest purchasing power?

All these questions can pile on and\n                    leave you second-guessing your next move, but language\n                    localization is easy when you find clarity around your\n                    goals.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Expanding into global markets requires careful language\n                    selection to maximize impact and ROI. Identifying market\n                    priorities is the first step in choosing the right\n                    localization languages. Focus on regions where demand exists\n                    and where your business can thrive.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next, analyze customer data to understand your audience\u2019s\n                    origins. Website analytics, customer inquiries, and social\n                    media interactions can uncover key markets. Furthermore,\n                    strategic decisions should consider language-overlapping\n                    markets where multiple languages are spoken, such as India\n                    or Switzerland. Localization should also align with consumer\n                    behaviour and digital trends. Some markets prioritize </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mobile apps</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, while others engage more with desktop\n                    content.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Testing localized versions through small-scale campaigns\n                    can provide valuable insights before entirely investing. You\n                    can optimize your localization efforts and confidently\n                    expand globally by focusing on high-impact languages\n                    first\u2014such as </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-kannada-translation/\"><b>English to Kannada Translation</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, to target Karnataka\u2019s audience.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Typically, the following steps involve selecting which\n                    language to localize after entering a new market. This\n                    entails identifying opportunities for business growth and\n                    evaluating the economic, cultural, and strategic suitability\n                    of entering that market.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Language localization will help you adapt your\n                    <a href=\"https://bertschinnovation.com/en/blog/what-is-product-content/\"><b>content and products</b></a>\n                    to appeal to target audiences only after you decide on those\n                    markets.

        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  Five-Step Strategy in The Localization Framework.\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Localization makes products and information more suited to\n                    target particular markets. Similar to translating,\n                    localization is tactical, and being multilingual is a\n                    strategic choice. What comes next after localization is the\n                    question. Five organized steps comprise this framework,\n                    which aims to provide a high return on investment while\n                    maintaining localization in line with corporate\n                    growth.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  1. Prioritize Markets\n                </h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before focusing on specific languages, determine where\n                    localization efforts could create the most significant\n                    value. Rather than striving to capture every possible market\n                    simultaneously, establish a priority order according to the\n                    market\u2019s interest and business potential.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Start by analyzing all available information sources. Your\n                    website analytic report will give clues about the regions\n                    sending traffic to your site. Customer support requests will\n                    articulate particular language gaps in user interaction.\n                    Likewise, sales inquiries or engagement metrics will\n                    indicate where demand is most potent.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conversely, behavioral insight is indispensable. Some\n                    markets may show excellent engagement levels with your\n                    content even if language barriers exist, while other regions\n                    may not settle for anything less than a localized\n                    experience. Mobile-first e-commerce markets, in particular,\n                    may favor localized apps rather than translated desktop\n                    interfaces. These subtleties will undoubtedly help refine\n                    market priorities.\n                  </span>\n</p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  2. Analyze Audience Behaviour and Preferences\n                </h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once key markets have been picked, look into how audiences\n                    interact with your content and what\u2019s on their minds as they\n                    decide to purchase.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",

A highly\n                    additional aspect of this process is developing\n                    transliteration APIs that change foreign scripts to more\n                    recognizable forms and allow smooth interaction with several\n                    languages.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",

When a similar text\n                    occurs in a new translation, the automated translation\n                    process allows the system to suggest these pre-translated\n                    elements to the translator.

About 7,000 languages are spoken\n                    worldwide; thus, they are not spoken everywhere, and not\n                    every cultural sentiment can be shared.

Thus, content localization becomes\n                    significantly important for any business trying to establish\n                    itself in the international market.

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-form content requires every sentence to be\n                    contextually relevant and flow naturally amidst the\n                    surrounding copy, unlike the isolated words and phrases that\n                    litter a digital storefront or landing page. Culturally\n                    relevant language increases credibility and makes the\n                    message feel natural and relatable to the intended\n                    audience.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-form content localization seems like a big task;\n                    however, never fear; you are not all obliged to do the work\n                    alone. This guide will define content localization, discuss\n                    the various types of long-form content localization, and\n                    execute success in strategy creation for localizing your\n                    content.\n                  </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-form content localization is the adaptation of longer\n                    pieces of written content such as articles or guides for a\n                    specified region through  </span><b>English to Kannada Translation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    or other. The adaptation process goes beyond mere\n                    translation from one language into another. Localization\n                    involves translations with accuracy, but it also has to do\n                    with making the translated content sound natural and\n                    pertinent. While localizing their long-form content, the\n                    businesses should be cognizant of cultural norms and\n                    practices. For instance, visual images and designs in your\n                    marketing contents may even be adapted to fit cultural\n                    standards. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After the localization process begins, a company will have\n                    done market research to narrow down the potential target\n                    markets and set a translation process. Once the leaders have\n                    picked their target market, they can start factoring in\n                    which translation tools and methods best fit the companies’\n                    need while translating long-form content. The correct method\n                    depends on the company’s quality, turnaround time, and cost\n                    goals for each project. Translating long-form content\n                    usually tends to be time- and cost-heavy, so careful\n                    planning is warranted. </span>\n</p>",

Therefore,\n                    localization project managers could face a demanding\n                    workload performing manual tasks such as copying and pasting\n                    strings for translation across spreadsheets. Hence, to\n                    handle the multilingual production of content, global\n                    companies rely on translation APIs such as Devnagri\n                    AI.</span>\n</p>",

More than 125 million people\n                    worldwide use Punjabi in their everyday communications.\n                    Under such circumstances, proper translation is no longer\n                    just a communication channel through which to communicate.\n                    This can serve as a practical paradigm within which reach,\n                    engagement, and growth can be modelled. Automated\n                    translation tools significantly enhance translation speed,\n                    accuracy, and scalability. Hence, it would empower the\n                    businesses to create a more significant impact because\n                    Punjabi-speaking people would relate to the content and, at\n                    the same time, retain the original message.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Among the most spoken languages in the world, Punjabi is\n                    the primary language of India, Pakistan, Canada, and the UK.\n                    Businesses dealing with Punjabi products and services tend\n                    to reach millions of potential customers’ mouths, all eager\n                    to consume the coveted content in their native tongue.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Punjabi is more than a language; it’s an identity. It\n                    brings businesses the acknowledgement of cultural\n                    sensitivities from their targeted audience, and such trust\n                    develops loyalty. Whether the material to be marketed,\n                    described products, or legal documents, it bridges the gap\n                    between a business and its targeted customers through\n                    English-to-Punjabi translation.</span>\n</p>",

For Punjabi speakers, overall\n                    experience improves significantly, engagement improves, and\n                    conversions increase if content appears in Punjabi.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Speed and Efficiency: Machine translation, powered by AI,\n                    delivers large volumes of content in record time. Little\n                    time to get through content or keep it up to date does not\n                    matter for businesses. For example, an e-commerce platform\n                    can sell products quickly on the list of Punjabi-speaking\n                    customers.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most would have technology do the work, and human\n                    post-editing would give the final assurance that the\n                    translation is culturally appropriate and linguistically\n                    correct. Thus, the approach becomes a hybrid, balancing AI\n                    speed with the expertise of a native speaker to deliver\n                    quality translations. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consistency Throughout the Content: Previously translated\n                    phrases and terminologies can be stored within the memory\n                    tools for translation, creating a consistent message across\n                    all Punjabi translations for businesses running multiple\n                    campaigns.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cost-Effective Scalability: Translation technology\n                    significantly reduces cost levels for business houses. This\n                    is especially true for massive undertakings. Considering all\n                    of that, automated tools are still combined with or\n                    supplemented by human help to make converting English to\n                    Punjabi even more scalable without exceeding budgets.</span>\n</p>",

Understanding\n                    Punjabi cultural norms, traditions, and values will ensure\n                    that the content resonates with the target audience on a\n                    deeper level.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also known as back translation, reverse translation\n                    involves rendering the contents into the original language\n                    and comparing them with the source text. This important\n                    localization quality control technique ensures software\n                    internationalization.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  What is Reverse Translation?\n                </h2>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The re-translation of material from the target language is\n                    reversed into the source language, for example, when\n                    performing </span><strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-assamese-translation/\">English to Assamese translation</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    or English to German for literal purposes, known as back\n                    translation or reverse translation. For instance, if the\n                    content were being translated from English to Swedish, the\n                    rewriter would have back-translated it into English so that\n                    the intent of that translated version would be immediately\n                    apparent. Reverse translations do not affect the translation\n                    memory or any other resources the translator may use, such\n                    as glossaries.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In specified circumstances, the retranslation or double\n                    translation becomes more critical, i.e., when the content\n                    includes taglines, slogans, titles, names of products,\n                    jokes, and puns. The reason is that such a difference in the\n                    content of languages is not implied to mean the same for\n                    another language or region. The back translation allows the\n                    content owner to scrutinize how creative liberties adapted\n                    the content to that of the market. Most often, the\n                    availability of this complex content warrants the\n                    translator’s offer of multiple options so the source content\n                    owner can make the most sensible decision for the\n                    brand.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is often confused with double translation, in which a\n                    translator performs a piece of content in multiple ways to\n                    accommodate the nuances of various words and phrases.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reverse translation is generally considered a method of\n                    quality assurance, and the Reverse translation process goes\n                    like this: </span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Translate your content into the target\n                      language. </span>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have another linguist do a rigorous, word-for-word\n                      translation of this text Reverse to the source\n                      language. </span>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compare the Reverse translation to the original text to\n                      ensure the Reverse translation is accurate and\n                      complete. </span>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you finalize your reverse translations, you may\n                      commence a reconciliation process to resolve any\n                      discrepancies, correct any errors, and finalize your\n                      translation. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quality assurance is an essential part of any translation\n                    process. One way to rate quality is to review Reverse\n                    translations, especially when multiple translation\n                    possibilities are involved. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  The best types of Reverse-translated content\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When a blog post is translated, its content still expresses\n                    the source germ, so reverse-translated content should not be\n                    needed. The language should not be changed multiple times\n                    from the original message. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Often, translators change </span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/Idioms-metaphors-similes-and-hyperbole\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">idioms, analogies, or references</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    that relate more closely to the culture they are writing\n                    for. This may include restructuring sentences or even\n                    paragraphs and sometimes swapping content. Images such as\n                    this will mostly keep the original idea and even\n                    wording. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet other types of content require Reverse translation when\n                    you are doing French to German or </span><b>English to Assamese translation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Industries with high-stakes content sensitive enough to\n                    demand perfection, such as medicine, where a single\n                    translation error could turn life into death, arguably need\n                    Reverse translation. Particular states have regulatory,\n                    ethics review committee, and institutional review board\n                    requirements for their industries that, per their policy,\n                    apply to any translation process. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That includes content like: </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Medical:  Clinical trials, pharmaceutical companies,\n                    clinical research, medical devices, and consent\n                    forms. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Data: Survey results, questionnaires, polling, and\n                    research. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Legal: Contracts, legal documents and instruments, case\n                    files and other necessary paperwork, insurance policies, and\n                    other binding documents.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When should we use the Reverse translation solution, and\n                    when should we not? Reverse translation can be valuable in\n                    your localization strategy but may not cater to every\n                    company or project. For most of your requirements, like\n                    media translation, eLearning translation, and\n                    <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/banking-finance-translation/\">banking finance translation</a></strong>, a well-trusted localization partner such as Devnagri AI\n                    would provide peace of mind with automated reporting and\n                    intensive quality checks that help ensure high-quality\n                    output.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  Why Use Reverse Translation?\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some reasons: You work in a highly regulated\n                    industry such as financial services, healthcare, or\n                    insurance, where you must exert considerable effort to\n                    manage risks or meet regulatory requirements. Your concern\n                    is much less for creativity, style, or expression than\n                    accuracy and precise terminology. You have time and dollars.\n                    Reverse translation introduces another layer, taking time\n                    for different languages to finish.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  Final thoughts on Reverse (back) Translation\n                </h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reverse translation can improve accuracy, especially in\n                    complicated Asian languages like Assamese, Odia, Bengali,\n                    and more. It is also useful in high-stakes industries such\n                    as media translation, eLearning translation, banking finance\n                    translation and even creative content. </span><b>English to Assamese translation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    using the Reverse process helps identify discrepancies and\n                    potential issues, preserves original intent, and keeps\n                    translations relevant across cultures. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It does add to the cost and time of your project; however,\n                    it is essential where great precision is needed. For\n                    instance, commissioning a creative campaign can make the\n                    difference between a campaign that falls flat and one that\n                    engages international audiences.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By far, the most interesting and significant aspect in the\n                    field of business is that 95% of prospective consumers exist\n                    outside the domestic market of a company.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Considering this outlook, companies that limit themselves\n                    to domestic markets are effectively competing for a mere 5%\n                    of their potential clients. Top brands, such as Netflix,\n                    garner more than 60% of their revenue from foreign\n                    markets.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gaining first-mover advantages in international markets\n                    creates unprecedented opportunities for client acquisition\n                    and brand building using </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation-api/\"><b>machine translation API</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Early European expansion and sound positioning made it\n                    hard for even well-capitalized local competitors to match or\n                    even challenge Airbnb. Similarly, Spotify’s early entrance\n                    into Latin America in 2013 resulted in an acquisition of\n                    over 40% of the market in key countries such as Brazil. This\n                    highlights the need to enter foreign markets strategically\n                    before serious competition arises.\n                  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Market positioning and cultural intelligence are essential\n                    in this context.

When you decide on\n                    marketing for global expansion, you need to consider a\n                    certain number of things.

Transcreation aims to express the same content\n                    and subtleties as the original text while accounting for the\n                    following:</span>\n</p>",

So, there are two forms of multilingual\n                    support:</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Customer service: Helping customers through chat, email, or\n                    phone in the language they feel most comfortable with.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Self-service resources: Creating FAQs, help articles,\n                    guides, and tutorials in multiple languages so customers can\n                    find answers whenever they want.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/10/creating-customer-service-bots-that-people-dont-hate\">People want to feel understood</a>. When you speak their language, you present the image that\n                    you care, which helps build trust and makes life easier for\n                    them. For businesses, this is a plausible door to new\n                    markets, happier customers, and an excellent reputation. For\n                    this reason, investing in translation and localization is\n                    essential.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With that, let\u2019s go to the why of multilingual\n                    support.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  Benefits of Multilingual Support (with examples)\n                </h2>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Customer support in multiple languages is one way to\n                    connect with a diverse global population. It should be an\n                    essential component of your localization effort. Here are\n                    five reasons why it matters, with relatable examples to help\n                    you better understand them.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  1. Expand your reach\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Put into a support line in multiple languages, and you have\n                    made it easy for global customers to interact with your\n                    business. Each language is a key to a new market.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, Airbnb operates in over 60 languages, so\n                    travellers from every corner of the earth would feel at home\n                    on their platform.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Example of multilingual support by Airbnb</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AirBnb\u2019s help centre has been transformed into more than 60\n                    languages, including German.\n                  </span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  2. Build trust and brand loyalty\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conversing with a customer in their language demonstrates\n                    that you care and understand that client. It allows them to\n                    provide you with instructions or report an issue in a\n                    language they feel comfortable speaking.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An excellent example is this. With confidence, Shopify\n                    support services allow entrepreneurs from Japan to Brazil to\n                    grow their businesses, knowing they can always get\n                    help.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Example of multilingual support by Shopify:\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shopify\u2019s Help Centre exists in 18 languages, with a French\n                    view illustrated here. Its AI-powered chatbot supports\n                    French, too.\n                  </span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  3. Increase customer satisfaction\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The customers need to be sure that no miscommunication\n                    interrupts the flow of their supported interactions and\n                    experiences. Multilingual support, on the other hand, offers\n                    an easy-going and pleasant experience.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consider Amazon. Its multilingual help centres ensure that\n                    dozens of languages are available so customers can quickly\n                    resolve complexities and queries.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Example of multilingual support by Amazon:\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indeed, you can pick your language whether it is </span><b>English to Odia translation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n                    or for Malayalam and currency while browsing Amazon. That\n                    preference also applies to customer support and the help\n                    centre.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  4. Remain Competitive\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a global market, multilingual customer service is but a\n                    commodity on par with near-real-time response. Customers are\n                    now expecting seamless service, but that journey is\n                    incomplete if, from wherever they seek help, they are not\n                    speaking their native tongue.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You may have heard about or even used Duolingo. The app\u2019s\n                    Retention rates have soared, thanks partly to its mascot, a\n                    passive-aggressive green owl! The company, however, also\n                    walks the talk.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual customer support availability keeps them ahead\n                    in a very competitive language education world.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Selector for languages from Duolingo</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Duolingo website is in 28 languages. All other\n                    resources, including FAQs and help articles, follow your\n                    language preference.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">\n                  5. Strengthen revenue and growth.\n                </h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Better support equals better business. Customers who feel\n                    they have been attended to are more willing to buy, stay\n                    loyal, and tell their friends about you.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Look at Netflix, the global streaming giant. Its\n                    multilingual customer support and content localization have\n                    allowed it to conquer international markets while\n                    continuously fueling subscriber growth worldwide.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having defined the great benefits of multilingual support,\n                    it is time to strategize on the best methods for its\n                    implementation, considering that there is no one-way path to\n                    business change</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An AI bot is the best solution to ensure adequate trust,\n                    communication, and resolution time if you\u2019re considering\n                    Latin American expansion or the Spanish-speaking or\n                    Portuguese-speaking market.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The online language operates mainly in English, but only\n                    25.9 per cent of internet users worldwide use it. The rest\n                    use Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, and other languages.</span>\n</p>"

      "content": [
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2005, the Indian government declared Assamese a classical language, summarizing its rich historical and literary tradition. More than 15 million people speak this language, mainly in the northeastern state of Assam.

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The status of a classical language underlines that Assamese is not a vernacular of the nineteenth or twentieth century alone. On the contrary, it has a long, undisturbed history tracing back to the ancient Indo-Aryan languages, particularly Magadhi Prakrit. This wealth lineage is reflected in its grammatical peculiarities, various dialects, and vast and varied literary heritage spanning centuries. According to the 2011 census, </span><a href=\"https://www.worlddata.info/languages/assamese.php#:~:text=Assamese%20speaking%20countries&amp;text=In%20India%2C%20the%20number%20of,communities%20in%20Bhutan%20and%20Bangladesh.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18.7</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million people choose Assamese as their first language. The 148th most spoken language in the world is Assamese.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If translated meaningfully and adequately, the accuracy comes from knowing just how deep one thing is. To consider all those, language translators must research language history, changes in dialect forms, grammatical variations, or vocabularies of any language. When used to translate one’s source work, it does justice to translate the text at hand and pass it on quite authentically in Assamese. Preserving Culture</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long heritage of Assamese literature is a treasure trove of knowledge, wisdom, and cultural expressions. From the devotional poetry of Srimanta Sankaradeva to the contemporary narratives of Assam writers, Assamese literature reflects a unique identity and a rich cultural heritage that will intrigue and inspire.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be considered a classical language, a language must permanently preserve and promote its heritage. Accurate translation is essential in making literary wealth accessible to people who do not know Assamese. Translating Assamese into English and other languages allows us to share the beauty and wisdom of that cultural heritage with the world, developing intercultural understanding and appreciation.</span></p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Assamese grammar differs significantly from English grammar, with verb conjugation matching in gender, number, and person. Classifiers define nouns, whereas the sentence formation is subject-object-verb against the English standard of subject-verb-object word order. For this, translators are required to have complex grammatical skills to achieve both exact and fluent rendering.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Dialectical variations:</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assamese have different dialects, each with vocabulary, intonation, and grammar. Translators should be aware of these differences and thus translate, considering the readership and communicative context. For example, if one is translating for a general market, one might opt for a more standardized form of Assamese. However, the translator would use the local dialect when translating for a specific local community.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Literary and Cultural Colloquialisms:</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English to Assamese Translation literature demands a thorough understanding of the cultural, historical, and literary context and style. The translator should be attuned to the artistic aspects of words and phrases, historical episodes, persons who have contributed to Assamese literature and style, and the different varieties and genres within the Assamese cultural experience.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">More wealth:</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government attention and academic research will naturally lead to the better availability of more resources for language research in Assamese, including detailed dictionaries, proper grammar, and extensive language corpora. These resources will help translators produce high-quality translations, and they will be invaluable.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Cultural exchange:</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation will increase cultural interaction between Assamese and English-speaking peoples, fostering mutual understanding, appreciation, and cooperation. This will be possible by translating Assamese literature, films, and other cultural products into English and introducing Assamese culture’s wealth and diversity to a global audience.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assamese is gaining importance nationally and internationally, rapidly increasing the demand for </span><b>English to Assamese Translation.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This growing demand in literature, education, governmental affairs, and tourism presents a promising opportunity for translators to disseminate Assamese culture and knowledge to a broader audience.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Indispensable Role of Machine Translation</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While technology may support the translation, it is a very technical task to be completed only with the expertise of human minds, considering the complexity and nuance Assamese embodies within its literature and culture. Therefore, for adept translators to effectively communicate meaning, they must possess knowledge of both languages and Assamese culture, which is closely linked to understanding the nuances in the source text. You can further refine the translation to suit the context and audience in such a way that the translated text is not only accurate but also engaging.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Conclusion</h3>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would help efficiently maintain and popularize Assamese’s rich linguistic and cultural heritage. <strong>English to Assamese Translation</strong> can now be essential in spreading Assamese literature and knowledge worldwide. Proper translation that shows a country’s artistic sensitivity and the difficulties of using a classical language like Assamese must be maintained, considering both the benefits and drawbacks of such recognition.</span></p>",

Language translation\n                    is a subset of localization. Localization, on the other\n                    hand, is more broad. Localization not only includes language\n                    translation but also cultural nuances, religious\n                    sensitivities, local attire, local festivals, local cuisine,\n                    and many more subtle things.</span>\n</p>",

Even if your audience can understand your\n                    content from a language standpoint, they may not be related\n                    to their culture and identity and may not trust you\n                    fully.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As discussed earlier, 75% of consumers prefer buying\n                    products in their native language. A multilingual content\n                    strategy is necessary if you are targeting market expansion.\n                    Today, brands run campaigns across different channels to\n                    connect with their audience. Imagine that if you are\n                    connecting with your audience not only in your audience\u2019s\n                    preferred channel but also in their preferred language, you\n                    are likely to build more trust with your audience and drive\n                    more engagement.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual content marketing is more than simple\n                    translation. It focuses more on culturally nuanced\n                    communication that fosters meaningful connections with your\n                    audience. Global brands are carefully adapting every piece\n                    of content translation to the local markets.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think of it as a comprehensive transformation of your\n                    entire content ecosystem, from blog posts and articles to\n                    social media campaigns, press releases, video content,\n                    infographics, podcasts, newsletters, and ebooks. Each piece\n                    must be thoughtfully localized to reflect local cultural\n                    contexts, preferences, and consumer behaviors.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The impact of localized content on business metrics is\n                    significant. Engagement rates typically soar when your\n                    audience encounters content that speaks to them in their\n                    language and cultural context.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even within English-speaking markets, regional differences\n                    matter enormously. A marketing campaign that resonates in\n                    New York might fall flat in London or Sydney.

Their slogan, \u201cI\u2019d like to buy the world a\n                    Coke,\u201d was translated into over 200 languages.\n                  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, Coca-Cola enjoys mass popularity beyond any specific\n                    boundary and nation. It had such a monopoly that people who\n                    were drinking or buying any soda used to say Coke or Cola.\n                    This proves a consistent message can resonate with a global\n                    audience in multiple languages.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brands are building a loyal customer base in their region\n                    and others with localization and personalization. This shows\n                    how dialects and accents impact sales and\n                    growth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>",

It is the\n                    state housing some of the country\u2019s leading seaports:\n                    Mundra, Kandla, and Pipavav. These have been the crucial\n                    points for international trade and commerce. As the ports\n                    have developed further and a larger volume of cargo comes\n                    in, the need of the hour is effective communication.

English is the standard international maritime\n                    communication, but many local employees and business\n                    communities at the ports in Gujarat continue to use Gujarati\n                    as the communication medium.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>In this highly digitalised world, a website is essentially the first face of any brand to a customer. A positive, engaging experience will, therefore, be furthered if that first impression can be made in the visitor’s language. It is an essential step toward reaching new audiences and thereby success for brands hoping to meet those new audiences internationally.<br/>In this guide, we’ll be covering everything you need to know about website translation and how a<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong> Website Translation</strong></a> can make all the difference in your business.</p>",
        "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Why Does Website Translation Matter?</h2>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crossing boundaries of new markets requires more than the translation of words but also adapting your website to other people’s hearts.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key advantages include:</span></p>",
        "<h5><b>1. Better User Experience:</b></h5>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A site that says something to users will make them spend more time on it. Content that is familiar and accessible boosts the users’ trust and interaction.</span></p>",
        "<h5><b>2. More Accessible Market:</b></h5>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a website translator you can have any number of languages desired, those markets that were previously closed to you can now be opened. This is especially the case with English-speaking countries.</span></p>",
        "<h5><b>3. Improved SEO</b><b>:</b></h5>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Localization of content will give a good rank in search engines all over the world. Writing for target languages and optimizing URLs in local languages improve the possibility of being discovered by international customers.</span></p>",
        "<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Key Considerations for Effective Website Translation</h3>",
        "<ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choosing Target Languages Choose the right languages. You must realize what languages are mostly found among your targeted users. For instance, some giant languages have an extensive spread like Hindi. But, as far as the industry-specific areas are concerned, it would be better to concentrate on the smaller regions.</span></li></ol>",
        "<ol start=\"2\"><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cultural Localization The translation goes beyond words, including images, graphics, and typesetting variations that may vary with regional differences. Localization is the process that ensures your website looks and feels at home in each culture with increased interaction. The right website translation agency will have the ability to adapt translations and cultural realities.</span></li></ol>",
        "<ol start=\"3\"><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Quality Control in Translation Quality first. Linguistic and technical quality is ensured by passing through several rounds of review by qualified translators. Major agencies have a good quality control system, direct access to expert linguists, editors, and subject-matter specialists, etc.</span></li></ol>",
        "<ol start=\"4\"><li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Technical Aspects Ensuring technical compatibility with your Content Management System (CMS) is important, especially in the management of multilingual content. Most CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal also have plugins or modules for language management and website translation. Finally, responsive design and CDNs help keep the site speed around the world even when one is adding more languages.</span></li></ol>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Machine Translation vs. Human Translation</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In translating a website, companies can choose to go for Machine Translation (MT), Human Translation, or a mix of both:</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Machine Translation –</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Machine translation tools, like Google Translate, are very fast with text translation and very economical for big projects. However cultural nuances and accuracy for quality content might be missing in machine translation.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Human Translation – </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality translation by a human translator is guaranteed due to understanding and being sensitive towards context, tone, and cultural relevance. A human translation takes more time but results in a better and more refined product.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Hybrid Approach: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies discover that a hybrid approach is the best—in other words, using MT as an initial translation followed by human review. That speeds up the process while maintaining quality for website translators.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Choosing the Right Website Translation Agency</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing an ideal website translation agency can smoothen and facilitate the process to be easier and more efficient. Here’s what to look for:</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>1. Industry Expertise</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choose an agency that is experienced in your industry; they will have a more targeted understanding of the terminology and tone that your brand requires.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>2. Seamlessness in Services</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want an agency that will translate more than just words. Identify an agency with services for cultural localization, SEO, testing, and even quality assurance.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>3. Compatibility with Technology</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure the website translator agency can work within your CMS or technical framework. Some agencies may offer integrations or APIs, but this will depend on the other workflow requirements you might need to implement, such as updating content in multiple languages.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>4. Transparent Pricing and Timelines</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost and delivery schedules are important so that you can manage your project efficiently. Ask them about pricing models (per word, hourly, or by project) and timelines to avoid unknown costs and unexpected delays for website translators.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implementation Steps for Website Translation</span></p>",
        "<h5 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Here is the step-by-step translation process:</h5>",
        "<h6><b>1. Project Planning:</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work with your team and translation partner to determine the scope, languages, and timeline for a website translator. Set goals and target audiences to guide localization efforts.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>2. Integrate Website DOTA:</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devnagri AI introduces the DOTA (Devnagri on the air) web, which is a website translation API that translates websites in real time as the abbreviation says. It can translate the website immediately after integration.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>3. Translation and Localization:</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Professional website translators and localization professionals will make the text, images, and functional elements reflect the cultural tastes and needs of your target market.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>4. Quality Assurance and Testing:</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test each language on your website before you launch to guarantee that formatting, links, as well as functionality, will translate across languages, without compromising in the translation.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>5. Launch and Monitor:</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then you can monitor engagement on your translated site and edit it according to your analysis.</span></p>",
        "<h5 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Common Issues in Website Translation</h5>",
        "<h6><b>1. Brand Consistency</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When working with multiple translators, it is vital to maintain a consistent tone and style of the brand. A better website translation agency can make it happen by providing a style guide and glossary of keywords.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>2. Multilingual SEO</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization strategies vary according to language and geographic location. Optimizing your translated content using localized keywords, metadata, and URL structure allows search engines to find you.</span></p>",
        "<h6><b>3. Cultural Sensitivity</b></h6>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, regarding small misunderstandings, it can sometimes result in big problems. That is why you have to work with translators who are very aware of all these cultural differences. For example, different regions have different colors, symbols, and humor so understanding the culture will save one from many misunderstandings.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Successful Tips to Consider</h4>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some practical tips for you to consider during your website translator journey:</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start Small and Scale: Start with high-priority languages to test the waters, then gradually expand to more as you see engagement grow.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize for Mobile: An increasing number of web users in developing countries access the internet via mobile phones only. So, focusing on providing mobile-friendly sites becomes essential.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporation of Local Content: Feedback from local users guides the fine-tuning of localization efforts into a website.</span></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain the Translation Current: Update your translations as the content of your website changes. Very old translations would be misleading to your visitors.</span></p>",
        "<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Conclusion</h4>",
        "<h5 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Why Should You Opt for Devnagri?</h5>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Translating Your Website in <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\">Indian Languages Translation</a></strong> of your website can be a powerful tool in reaching the world with your message and conveying it in several cultures.

And if you ever need to touch a mass audience or go\n                    across different languages and cultures, the right tools can\n                    make all the difference for your brand.

Consider a customer in\n                    Tamil Nadu or Maharashtra coming to your website and reading\n                    content on your website instantly in their native language.\n                    That\u2019s the power of a machine translation API: It eliminates\n                    language barriers that can limit the reach of your\n                    message.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adding a machine translation API not only makes this more\n                    accessible but may also inspire customers to engage. Many\n                    research studies reveal that users engage more with content\n                    that feels and sounds culturally relevant and familiar.\n                    Moreover, the Transliteration API helps Indian businesses or\n                    those entering the Indian market ensure content resonates\n                    with the local audience.

        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In India, it is a little more complicated due to the sheer\n                    number of scripts. Transliteration, or text in one script\n                    written into another script, can be as important as the\n                    translation. Transliteration APIs take the text in one\n                    script\u2014for example, the Latin alphabet\u2014and translate it into\n                    another script\u2014 Devanagari for Hindi or Kannada\n                    script\u2014making content more accessible and readable for local\n                    audiences.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, when translating a brand name or product from\n                    English to Bengali, literal translation is not enough. A\n                    transliteration API ensures that all your content stays\n                    readable and relevant in the target script so that end-users\n                    will instantly understand and relate to it.</span>\n</p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have you ever visited a website in a different language and felt lost?\n      Many people leave sites because they can’t understand the content. In\n      today’s world, multilingual websites are essential. They help businesses\n      reach a broader audience, connecting with 75% more internet users who\n      don’t speak English (Source: </span><a href=\"https://brightplugins.com/seo-statistics-for-multilingual-websites/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bright plugins</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The internet is global, so having a multilingual website is crucial. Keep\n      reading to learn how to grow your business in different languages.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>What are Multi-Language Websites?</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual websites have content in many languages. They help\n      businesses connect with people who speak different languages. These sites\n      use language translation tools for accurate translations. This includes\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation-api/\">machine translation</a>\n      and translation APIs.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual websites do more than translate words. They also consider\n      cultural differences, changing images, symbols, and colors to fit local\n      tastes. By doing this, businesses make their websites more welcoming,\n      which helps attract and retain a global audience.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>Why a Multi-Language Website Is Beneficial to Your Business</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating a multilingual website has many benefits. It helps you reach\n      more people, improve user experience, and increase market potential. Let’s\n      look at why it’s important for your business.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Reach More People</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A multilingual website connects you with a global audience. Offering\n      content in different languages means more people can access and understand\n      your site. With accurate translations, users easily engage with your\n      content, leading to more visitors and better worldwide visibility.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Build Customer Trust</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Customers trust brands that speak their language. A multilingual website\n      shows you care about their needs. Clear translations build trust and\n      loyalty, encouraging repeat visits. When customers feel valued, they are\n      more likely to stay and engage with your site.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Gain a Competitive Edge</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having a multilingual website gives you an edge over competitors. Many\n      businesses operate in only one language. By offering multiple languages,\n      you stand out and attract a wider audience. This makes you more appealing\n      to non-English speakers. Accurate translations keep your site competitive\n      and relevant across different regions.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Improve SEO</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual websites boost your SEO. Search engines prefer sites with\n      content in various languages, increasing your chances of appearing in\n      search results. Accurate translations help localize keywords and improve\n      visibility, attracting organic traffic from all over the world.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Increase Conversions</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your content must be understandable to users if you want them to convert.\n      A multilingual website can enable visitors to find what they are looking\n      for easily. This is where accurate translations come in handy, as they\n      empower readers to make informed choices that will result in more sales or\n      sign-ups, depending on your business objectives. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In other words, creating an enjoyable user experience leads to higher\n      conversions, which drives up your enterprise’s sales volumes and\n      profitability.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By investing in a multilingual website, you will be able to reach out to\n      wider market segments while at the same time building their trust through\n      translation services that ensure all information put across is understood\n      by every individual, regardless of his or her mother tongue. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h3><b>Catering to the Diverse Audience</b></h3>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Designing a site that supports many languages indicates how much you care\n      about visitors’ needs. Making them feel valued and appreciated could be as\n      simple as allowing them to read everything in their language without\n      difficulties understanding what has been written. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, more people will likely stay longer, which means more\n      traffic. This can lead to higher conversion rates and, ultimately, better\n      sales figures.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies that offer content in multiple languages are committed to\n      serving a global audience. This approach builds trust and loyalty, which\n      are key to business success.</span>\n</p>",

The rest use the internet in their own languages, which highlights the\n      need for </span><b>multilingual websites</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Airbnb grew quickly by offering content in various languages, making it\n      easier for people worldwide to use its platform. Shopify also grew by\n      supporting many languages and attracting more international\n      customers.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By catering to non-English speakers, businesses can reach new markets.\n      Asia alone has over 2.6 billion internet users, presenting a huge\n      opportunity. (Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/9080/internet-usage-in-the-asia-pacific-region/#editorsPicks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Statista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). Embracing multiple languages can drive growth and ensure long-term\n      success in the global market.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>SEO and Multilingual Websites</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating a </span><b>multilingual website</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n      is more than just translating text; it’s a key strategy for boosting SEO.\n      Search engines like Google favor sites that offer content in multiple\n      languages. This helps you reach more users in their native languages,\n      increasing organic traffic and improving rankings. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s look at how multilingual websites enhance your SEO.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4><b>Localized Keywords</b></h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Using localized keywords is crucial. However, direct translations might\n      need to include local search terms. Research relevant keywords in each\n      language to ensure your content matches users’ needs. A keyword in English\n      might differ in Spanish. Adapting your keywords to fit local searches is\n      vital for </span><b>SEO success</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4><b>Improved User Experience</b></h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A site in a user’s native language provides a better experience. If users\n      understand the content, they stay longer and engage more. This reduces\n      bounce rates and boosts engagement, improving your SEO ranking. A great </span><b>user experience</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n      leads to higher satisfaction and loyalty, making users return.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4><b>Increased Dwell Time</b></h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When users find content in their language, they stay longer. This\n      increased </span><b>dwell time</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n      signals to search engines that your site is valuable and relevant. Longer\n      visits and lower bounce rates improve your SEO ranking. Engaging content\n      in multiple languages keeps users on your site, boosting\n      performance.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4><b>Enhanced Local SEO</b></h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multilingual websites help you target local markets effectively. By\n      creating region-specific content, you appear in local searches more often.\n      This boosts your visibility in specific markets, enhancing your </span><b>local SEO</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Tailoring content to regional preferences makes your site more relevant\n      to local users.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h4><b>Higher Conversion Rates</b></h4>",
        "<p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Visitors are more likely to convert if they understand the content.\n      Multilingual websites make it easier for users to decide or fill out\n      forms. Higher conversion rates directly impact business success and\n      improve your </span><b>SEO</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Search engines see high conversion rates as a sign of valuable content,\n      boosting your ranking.</span>\n</p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n    In today’s interconnected world media plays a very important role in shaping\n    your understanding of the culture’s events and perspectives. Think about an\n    image highlighting unique media content like newspapers movies social media\n    posts all in multiple languages. The visual encapsulates the challenge and\n    opportunity of global communication. With more than 7000 languages spoken\n    globally, language barriers can greatly impede access to information and\n    entertainment creating devices in our global society. That’s where\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/media-translations/\"><strong>media translation</strong></a>\n    truly comes into the picture. It works like a bridge helping you connect\n    people across different languages and cultures. In this guide, you can learn\n    everything about the important role of media translation in breaking down\n    language barriers.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>The power of media</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Global media has grown exponentially with news outlets streaming services\n    and social media platforms reaching audiences globally. The widespread\n    accessibility has the potential to inform and even entertain people from\n    different backgrounds. It helps you promote a shared global culture. The\n    vast array of languages spoken around the world presents a major challenge.\n    Without effective translation, most of your content remains inaccessible to\n    the native speakers this limitation can hinder understanding and also\n    restrict the dissemination of unique perspectives essential for a\n    well-rounded worldview.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Breaking down the walls- media translation in action</strong></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n      One of the most common forms of media translation is the use of subtitles\n      and dubbing in movies. The subtitles can provide you with a written\n      translation of the spoken language making it very easy for the viewers. On\n      the flip side dubbing makes it very easy to replace the original audio\n      with the translated version making it easier for your target audience to\n      engage without reading subtitles. Both the methods have their pros and\n      cons so you need to choose the one that aligns the best with your target\n      audience.\n    </li>\n<li>\n      News translation is very important for the dissemination of information\n      across borders. By translating news articles and online content you can\n      ensure that important information reaches a global target audience. It\n      fosters global awareness and understanding of current events.\n    </li>\n<li>\n      Machine translation tools including Google Translate have become\n      sophisticated. These tools use artificial intelligence to translate your\n      text and speech in real time making it easier for people to access your\n      media content in different languages.\n    </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p><strong>More than the details of media translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Effective <strong>media translation</strong> generally goes beyond literal\n    word-for-word translation. It requires you to have the right understanding\n    of the cultural context to ensure accurate representation and avoid any\n    misunderstandings. For example, idioms, humour and cultural references often\n    need to be adapted to align with your target audience. Without sensitivity,\n    your translations can mislead or even offend.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n    Localization takes cultural context a step further by adapting your content\n    to fit the specific cultural norms and preferences of your target audience.\n    You must know that the process includes way more than just translating words\n    it includes modifying visuals adjusting your formats and even changing\n    content to align with your local customs and values. For example, a\n    marketing campaign that works well for one country might need major\n    alterations to be effective in another country.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n    Above all you need to know that media translation is a very powerful tool\n    that breaks down the language barriers and even fosters global communication\n    by making information and entertainment accessible across languages media\n    translation promotes connection and shared experiences. As technology\n    advances the future of media translation looks even more promising with more\n    potential to further improve your interconnected world.\n  </p>",

Product names, descriptions, and reviews are common\n    elements of such websites’ content.

        "<p>\n    The entertainment business creates a large volume of audiovisual content\n    that must be translated for dubbing or subtitles without compromising the\n    substance to appeal to a worldwide audience.

        "<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Our social media footprints, or the user-generated data we leave on our\n    personal or company accounts, are both useful and fleeting.

        "<p>\n    A website is one of the main tools used in marketing for businesses.\n    Therefore, professional\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translation</strong></a>\n    can significantly expand the company’s potential audience. It is essential\n    to have a website professionally and accurately translated to convey the\n    image you intend to present to the audience. When a website is\n    professionally translated, it will ensure that potential customers find your\n    web page for the first time and find answers to what they are looking for.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Why Do You Need to Translate Your Website?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    You might be wondering why you should translate your website. It all depends\n    on the industry, the global market share, and other factors. Every company\n    has reasons why it invests in <strong>website translations</strong> for\n    global customers. Here are some of the main reasons why you should have your\n    website translated:\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Reach Wider Audience</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Translating your website into different languages is critical to reaching\n    the global market if you want to expand your brand. Most people nowadays\n    love brands that give their customers easy-to-understand content about their\n    brand. Therefore, translating your website will give access to a large\n    audience that may be interested in your products.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/evaluating-the-performance-of-machine-translation-apis/\">Evaluating the Performance of Machine Translation APIs</a></strong>\n</p>",
        "<p><strong>Creating Customer Satisfaction</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Translated websites promote higher customer satisfaction. It is important to\n    ensure the user experience is optimal; you can browse and make purchases\n    without problems, and the message on the page is attractive. When customers\n    realise that the company adapts its products to their needs, they will be\n    more satisfied. Ultimately, this promotes a better reputation, more\n    customers, and repeat business.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Enhanced SEO And Brand Visibility</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    The best way to increase traffic to a website is through SEO. Improving your\n    SEO strategies through the incorporation of language solutions will impact\n    the ranking of all your websites positively. Factors such as the number of\n    visitors visiting your website will also impact your SEO. Hence, when\n    promoting your website in different languages, your website is likely to\n    receive a high bounce rate, and eventually, the ranking will improve.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Being on the internet itself is a competitive advantage in many sectors. In\n    addition, considering <strong>website translation</strong> into different\n    languages will promote more significant differentiation from other\n    companies. The company will face a competitive disadvantage without proper\n    translation, losing to local and foreign companies with better-translated\n    content.\n  </p>",

        "<p><strong>Improved Reputation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    When a web page is well translated into different languages, it transmits an\n    image of the user’s internalisation experience and professionalism. The\n    website is the first contact different clients will have with the company.\n    Hence, it should always reflect the company’s good image and reputation.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Builds Brand Confidence</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    You want your customers to understand your product and your company’s image\n    whenever they find your website for the first time. Therefore, inaccurate\n    translation will ruin your attempt to create your brand as a professional in\n    the new market. Having an accurately translated website is critical so that\n    first-time customers will trust your company and find your message\n    consistent and engaging.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increases Sales</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    When a website is professionally translated, it is likely to increase sales\n    and turnover. <strong>Website translation</strong> facilitates the\n    achievement of new clients, which is reflected in the medium and long term.\n    Therefore, narrowing down the languages you translate into is critical\n    before deciding where demand for your product will likely be more\n    significant to achieve maximum return on your translation investment.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    If you want to expand your business globally and attract new customers, then\n    <strong>website translation</strong> is the best way. It is crucial to\n    ensure that your website is presented in a way that engages the audience and\n    makes them enjoy reading the content. To achieve this, it is essential to\n    work with professional translation agencies with experience and knowledge to\n    translate your website, regardless of the industry you belong to.\n  </p>",

        "<p>\n    Find out what you need before you hire an agency to translate your\n    documents. There are a lot of translation companies out there, so it’s not\n    easy to find one that does good work. Your work might need to be translated\n    by someone who knows a lot about law terms. Or, there may be a lot of jokes\n    or puns in the text. To convert your product manual, you need someone who is\n    skilled and knows how to do it clearly and technically.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n    Before you look for a translation solution, it’s helpful to know what you\n    need. When you choose a translation, you will base your choice on these\n    needs. After finding a reliable translation company, you can put more of\n    your attention on your business.\n  </p>",

        "<p><strong>Check for Quality and Experience</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    You want to make sure you get the best solution possible for every job. You\n    can tell the quality of a translation solution by how fast and correctly it\n    works. Good writing also shows attention to detail, correct grammar, and the\n    right choice of words. What can you do to make sure that the translation you\n    hire pays close attention to the little things? It’s editors who have the\n    most impact on that quality.\n    <strong>Language translation</strong> businesses need reviewers who are\n    skilled in their work.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Guarantee Your Confidentiality</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Are there private details about your business or goods in the document?\n    Would you risk its safety even if it doesn’t? You don’t want a\n    <strong>document translation</strong> that makes the papers they translate\n    public. Check the non-disclosure deal of a translation solution before you\n    decide. As an extra clause, confidentiality should be a part of all legal\n    deals. This should be written into the deal for any legitimate\n    <strong>translation agency</strong>. This is something that medical\n    translation should show you before they translate a paper. They should also\n    make sure that your papers are stored safely.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Hire Translation agency That Are Good at Specific Things</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n    You need a translation solution that knows a lot about a lot of different\n    fields. It makes more sense to do this than to switch between translations.\n    It’s also better than using a translation solution that sends out people who\n    aren’t trained to do the work. Some businesses don’t have translators for\n    legal, medical, or IT papers that are hard to understand. Let’s say you need\n    an English-to-Hungarian translation of a business paper. A good translator\n    who can work between English and your target language and is good with\n    money.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Ensure the Solution Holds Credentials</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Before you hire a <strong>document translation agency</strong>, find out\n    more about it. Check to see if it has the right certifications. Translations\n    that aren’t very good will have low standards and won’t have any\n    qualifications. Let’s say you need to translate files in certain fields. The\n    translation needs to be licensed to do the work. For instance, people who\n    translate legal papers need to be certified to do so. It’s not just to show\n    that these certificates exist. These things show that the translation\n    company is good.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    The <strong>document translation agency</strong> you hire needs to be able\n    to localize. Always keep in mind that not everything can be translated. One\n    thing that is deeply connected to one language or society is the use of\n    idioms and puns. Some things might be frowned upon in one society but okay\n    in another. Sometimes, the word won’t get across the way you mean it to,\n    even if you speak the same language.\n  </p>",

        "<p>\n    While not every professional entity will aim to reach a new target audience\n    who speaks a foreign language or requires medical document translation, many\n    will, and you could be one of them. If you own a business or organization\n    that needs certain things translated from one language to another, or from\n    one language to several different languages, you should invest in a\n    high-quality translation. But, why is that? What are the benefits of hiring\n    a professional\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translator</strong></a>? It turns out there are plenty. When you engage a competent translation\n    business, you may even save time. In this blog, we will discuss the top\n    advantages of hiring experienced translators.\n  </p>",

        "<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Text that needs to be translated into a new language often has a deadline.\n    Working with a competent translator business gives you peace of mind knowing\n    that everything will be translated efficiently. When you leave the work to\n    competent specialists, you won’t have to worry about translated documents\n    being late or missing the deadline. Set a time frame with a professional and\n    you can be confident that the jobs will be completed on time or ahead of\n    schedule.\n  </p>",

        "<p><strong>Good Mastery of Language</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    It is important to note that translators should be independent of computers\n    or untrained bilinguals to complete their translation work. Using an\n    incompetent website or translation is likely to result in a badly performed\n    result. Computer translations are only sometimes precise. Therefore, it is\n    difficult for your intended audience to get your message if you depend on\n    them exclusively. If you want your documents translated precisely and\n    without costly mistakes, choose a professional translation agency.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Accuracy is a key factor when translating medical text, legal text,\n    marketing text, or any other type of text. Unless you hire a specialist, you\n    risk jeopardizing linguistic precision. Professional translators do more\n    than simply translate the language; they also ensure that everything is\n    written correctly in terms of punctuation, grammar, spelling, symbols, and\n    other variables.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Cultural Understanding</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Translators possess the required attributes and skills for successful\n    translation and deeply understand the cultural intricacies linked to the\n    language. Typically, translators who are native speakers of the target\n    language consider cultural differences while translating your material.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Saves Money</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    While it is necessary to make a financial commitment to obtain an excellent\n    professional translation agency, the investment is well worth it. If you\n    choose a translation agency that entices you with a low price, it may hurt\n    your organization and the quality of work you receive. Don’t accept this\n    chance, which could result in additional fees to repair the poor translation\n    work. Choose a somewhat more expensive but highly experienced provider to\n    get the job done right the first time. If your projects are properly\n    translated, you may wind up making more money by targeting a new target\n    audience who speaks a different language.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Save Time</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Not every firm has the time or resources to devote to document translation.\n    That’s why hiring an outside professional is so beneficial. You can focus on\n    what you do best and devote your time, energy, and expertise to more\n    essential responsibilities while qualified\n    <strong>website translators</strong> handle your translation needs. This\n    way, you won’t waste time thinking about how and who will translate your\n    documents for you. You discover one highly skilled individual and can trust\n    that they will supply you with a correct, perfect translation.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    With the help of a reputable website translator will give you the resources\n    and tools you require for communication. They safeguard you against\n    mistranslations and cultural misunderstandings, allowing you to provide\n    information that is relevant to your target audience. Furthermore, they\n    provide professional assistance and translate papers with the maximum\n    accuracy and clarity.\n  </p>",

Yes,\n    films can be easily transcribed, and it makes sense to do so, especially\n    when the video contains important information. For example, a video of a\n    discussion, an interview, or even a conference is better understood when the\n    transcripts are correctly done. Professional transcriptionists carefully\n    listen to the video while watching it and transcribe it at the same\n    time.  In this blog, we will go over the reasons why you need reliable\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/transcription/\"><strong>video transcription agency</strong></a>.\n  </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong> Belo are some of the key reasons for using video transcription\n      agency</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p><strong> Higher Legal Compliance </strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    60% of people with listening problems work or attend school. Various\n    anti-discrimination legislation were implemented to protect people with\n    disabilities’ rights to access the same resources as others. Some of these\n    rules require that the movies be transcribed so that they are accessible to\n    everyone.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong> Facilitates Global Comprehension of Your Content</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    A corporation that operates in multiple nations, each of which speaks a\n    different language. For example, a corporation with operations in a certain\n    country may hold a conference in that area and want to make the debate\n    intelligible to all clients or partners so that they may learn more about\n    the business. Transcribing the video of the meetings could be the simplest\n    technique to notify customers and business partners about your solutions. To\n    gain a better understanding of it, you must first define\n    <strong>video transcription</strong>.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Helps To Rank Your Video</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Professional transcripts help your content rank in several ways. They help\n    to generate content for Google to crawl. When Google crawls content, it\n    looks for evidence that the content is useful to searchers. By having\n    transcription, you include keywords in your article for SERP ranking.\n    Crawlers require transcripts to analyze intent, and this data will provide\n    more relevant information about your company. Furthermore, relevance is a\n    major factor in ranking material.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Help Employees Concentrate</strong></p>",

        "<p>\n    Surveys have also revealed that visual memory is stronger than auditory\n    memory.

        "<p><strong>Increased Usability</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Transcribing videos improves usability and user experience by making the\n    video’s text visible. By giving your potential viewers the option of\n    listening, watching, or reading the content, you allow them to utilize or\n    share your knowledge more freely. Transcription allows the user to easily\n    copy and paste text for reference.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n    Depending solely on a video takes a lot of time. While many people are\n    visual learners, text is the most effective way to learn. A transcript\n    allows you to navigate text that they may have missed while watching the\n    video. People can just skip to the area they found difficult and continue\n    viewing. Users can gain better access to information and understand specific\n    points by effectively transcribing video content.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Bottomline</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Whether you own a small or large business, you understand the value of\n    reaching out to more people and eventually turning them into potential\n    customers. Transcribing your videos becomes critical when you wish to expand\n    your reach. <strong>Video transcription agencies</strong> can assist you in\n    efficiently transcribing your films since they have a large network of\n    competent transcriptionists with knowledge in a variety of fields.\n  </p>",

With over 7,000 languages\n    spoken globally, the need for effective translation solutions has become\n    paramount, facilitating understanding and fostering connections among\n    diverse communities. Among the myriad languages in existence, English and\n    Gujarati stand out as significant languages with rich cultural backgrounds.\n    In this blog post, we delve into the realm of\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-gujarati-translation/\"><strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong></a>, exploring its importance, challenges, and the role it plays in bridging\n    language gaps.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Understanding English and Gujarati</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    English, as one of the most widely spoken languages worldwide, serves as a\n    lingua franca in various domains, including business, academia, and\n    technology. Its prevalence can be attributed to historical colonialism,\n    globalization, and the dominance of English-speaking nations in global\n    affairs.\n  </p>",
        "<p>\n    On the other hand, Gujarati, an Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian\n    state of Gujarat, boasts a rich literary tradition and cultural heritage.\n    Spoken by over 55 million people globally, Gujarati holds significance not\n    only within Gujarat but also among the vast Gujarati diaspora settled around\n    the world.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Importance of English to Gujarati Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    In a multicultural and multilingual society, effective communication is key\n    to social integration, economic growth, and cultural exchange.\n    <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> serves as a bridge between\n    these two languages, facilitating interaction and understanding among\n    English speakers and the Gujarati-speaking populace.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Facilitating Business and Commerce</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    In an era of globalization, businesses operate on an international scale,\n    engaging with partners, clients, and consumers from diverse linguistic\n    backgrounds. <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> enables\n    companies to reach Gujarati-speaking markets, expanding their reach and\n    enhancing accessibility to their products and services.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Empowering Education and Knowledge Sharing</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Access to knowledge should not be restricted by linguistic barriers.\n    <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> plays a crucial role in\n    making educational resources, academic literature, and informational content\n    accessible to Gujarati speakers, thereby promoting literacy, learning, and\n    intellectual exchange.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Preserving Cultural Identity</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Language is intertwined with culture, serving as a vehicle for expressing\n    traditions, beliefs, and values.\n    <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> contributes to the\n    preservation and promotion of Gujarati culture by translating literary\n    works, religious texts, and cultural artifacts, ensuring that heritage is\n    passed down to future generations.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Challenges in English to Gujarati Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    While <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> offers numerous\n    benefits, it is not without its challenges. Translating between languages\n    with distinct grammatical structures, vocabulary nuances, and cultural\n    contexts requires skill, precision, and cultural sensitivity.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Idiomatic Expressions and Cultural Nuances</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Every language has its own set of idioms, proverbs, and cultural references\n    that may not have direct equivalents in other languages. Translating these\n    expressions accurately while preserving their intended meaning poses a\n    significant challenge for translators.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Technical and Specialized Content</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Translating technical or specialized content, such as scientific documents,\n    legal texts, or medical reports, requires not only linguistic proficiency\n    but also domain-specific knowledge. Translators must possess expertise in\n    both English and Gujarati to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate\n    translations.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Contextual Ambiguity</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Words and phrases often carry different meanings depending on the context in\n    which they are used. Translators must carefully consider the context\n    surrounding the text to accurately convey the intended message, avoiding\n    misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Role of Technology in Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Advancements in technology, particularly in the field of\n    <strong>machine translation</strong> and artificial intelligence, have\n    revolutionized the translation industry. Translation software and online\n    platforms offer instant translation services, making translations more\n    accessible and affordable for users worldwide. However, while these tools\n    can aid in simple translations, they often fall short in capturing the\n    nuances and complexities of human language, especially in literary or\n    creative works.\n  </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> plays a vital role in\n    facilitating communication, fostering cultural exchange, and promoting\n    inclusivity in our increasingly globalized world. By overcoming linguistic\n    barriers, translation enables individuals and communities to connect,\n    collaborate, and share knowledge across borders. While challenges may exist,\n    the significance of translation in bridging language gaps cannot be\n    overstated.

Whether it’s preserving cultural\n    heritage, facilitating business transactions, or fostering cross-cultural\n    understanding, the importance of translation cannot be overstated. By\n    embracing multilingualism and investing in translation efforts, we can\n    create a more inclusive and interconnected world where language is no longer\n    a barrier but a catalyst for collaboration and mutual enrichment.\n  </p>",

        "<p data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\">\n    In today’s interconnected world, the demand for cross-cultural content has\n    never been higher. From movies and TV shows to online videos and educational\n    materials, people around the globe are consuming content from different\n    regions and in various languages. However, language barriers can hinder the\n    accessibility and enjoyment of such content for non-native speakers. This is\n    where <strong>subtitle translation</strong> plays a crucial role, bridging\n    linguistic gaps and allowing content to reach a wider audience. In this blog\n    post, we’ll explore the significance of\n    <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations/\"><strong>subtitle translation</strong></a>\n    and its impact on global communication and cultural exchange.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Understanding Subtitle Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Subtitle translation</strong> is the process of translating spoken\n    dialogue and other audio elements into written text displayed on-screen. It\n    enables viewers who don’t understand the original language to follow along\n    and comprehend the content. Subtitles can be in the same language as the\n    audio, providing accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments, or\n    they can be translated into different languages to cater to diverse\n    audiences.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Breaking Down Language Barriers</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    One of the most evident benefits of <strong>subtitle translation</strong> is\n    its ability to break down language barriers. Imagine a foreign film with\n    compelling storytelling and powerful performances that captivate audiences\n    worldwide. Without subtitles, many viewers outside the film’s native\n    language would miss out on experiencing its brilliance. Subtitles allow\n    people to enjoy content in their preferred language, opening doors to new\n    cultures and perspectives.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Facilitating Global Communication</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    In today’s globalized society, effective communication across borders is\n    essential for various industries, including entertainment, business,\n    education, and diplomacy. <strong>Subtitle translation</strong> facilitates\n    this communication by making content accessible to international audiences.\n    Whether it’s a business presentation, an educational video, or a diplomatic\n    speech, subtitles ensure that the intended message is conveyed accurately,\n    regardless of linguistic differences.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Preserving Cultural Nuances</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    Language is deeply intertwined with culture, and nuances often get lost in\n    translation. However, skilled\n    <strong>subtitle translators</strong> understand the importance of\n    preserving these cultural nuances. From idiomatic expressions and wordplay\n    to historical references and colloquialisms, translating subtitles requires\n    more than just linguistic proficiency—it demands cultural sensitivity and\n    context awareness. By preserving these nuances,\n    <strong>subtitle translation</strong> enriches the viewing experience and\n    fosters cross-cultural understanding.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Expanding Market Reach</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    For content creators and distributors,\n    <strong>subtitle translation</strong> offers a strategic advantage in\n    expanding their market reach. By making their content accessible to a\n    broader audience, they can tap into new markets and increase revenue\n    potential. For example, a streaming solution that provides multilingual\n    subtitles can attract subscribers from different regions, boosting its\n    global presence and competitive edge in the industry. Similarly, filmmakers\n    and production companies can reach international audiences and gain\n    recognition on the global stage through\n    <strong>subtitle translation</strong>.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Challenges and Considerations</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    While <strong>subtitle translation</strong> offers numerous benefits, it\n    also presents challenges and considerations. Accuracy is paramount, as\n    mistranslations can distort the original meaning and lead to\n    misunderstandings. Additionally, subtitles must be synchronized with the\n    audio and displayed in a format that is easy to read without distracting\n    viewers from the on-screen action. Cultural sensitivities, dialectal\n    variations, and technical constraints are among the factors that subtitle\n    translators must navigate to deliver high-quality translations.\n  </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n    In an increasingly interconnected world,\n    <strong>subtitle translation</strong> plays a vital role in enhancing global\n    communication, fostering cultural exchange, and expanding market reach. By\n    breaking down language barriers, facilitating cross-cultural understanding,\n    and preserving cultural nuances, subtitles make content accessible and\n    enjoyable for audiences worldwide. As the demand for cross-cultural content\n    continues to grow, the importance of skilled\n    <strong>subtitle translation</strong> cannot be overstated. It serves as a\n    bridge that connects people from different backgrounds and languages,\n    enriching their lives through the power of storytelling and communication.\n  </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      In our interconnected world, where global communication is the norm, the\n      ability to bridge language barriers has become increasingly vital.\n      Language serves as a medium for expressing ideas, sharing cultures, and\n      fostering connections. However, with over 7,000 languages spoken\n      worldwide, the diversity of linguistic backgrounds often poses challenges\n      to effective communication. Among these languages is Gujarati, spoken by\n      millions of people primarily in the Indian state of Gujarat and by\n      diaspora communities around the globe.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      English, as one of the most widely spoken languages globally, plays a\n      pivotal role in international communication. Its prevalence in business,\n      academia, technology, and entertainment makes it a lingua franca for many.\n      However, for Gujarati speakers, navigating the vast sea of English content\n      can be daunting without adequate translation resources. This is where\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-gujarati-translation/\"><strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong></a>\n      steps in, serving as a crucial tool for breaking down language barriers\n      and fostering inclusivity.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Importance of Translation:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Translation serves as a bridge between languages, allowing individuals to\n      access information, ideas, and opportunities beyond their linguistic\n      boundaries. In the context of\n      <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong>, this process enables\n      Gujarati speakers to engage with a plethora of English-language content,\n      ranging from literature and scientific research to news and entertainment.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the primary benefits of translation is the democratization of\n      knowledge. By rendering English content into Gujarati, translation makes\n      valuable information accessible to a broader audience. Whether it’s\n      educational resources, legal documents, or medical information,\n      translation empowers Gujarati speakers to obtain critical knowledge in\n      their native language, eliminating barriers to understanding and\n      participation.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, translation preserves cultural heritage and identity. Language\n      is deeply intertwined with culture, and through translation, cultural\n      nuances and expressions are retained, enriching the linguistic landscape.\n      For Gujarati speakers, accessing content in their native language fosters\n      a sense of belonging and pride in their heritage, reinforcing cultural\n      bonds and preserving linguistic diversity.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      While <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> offers immense\n      benefits, it also presents unique challenges. Languages differ not only in\n      vocabulary and grammar but also in cultural context and idiomatic\n      expressions. Translating text requires more than just linguistic\n      proficiency; it demands a deep understanding of both source and target\n      cultures to convey the intended meaning accurately.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      One common challenge in translation is maintaining fidelity to the\n      original text while ensuring clarity and coherence in the translated\n      version. Literal translations often fail to capture the nuances of\n      language, leading to confusion or misinterpretation. Skilled translators\n      employ techniques such as localization, where the translation is adapted\n      to suit the cultural and linguistic norms of the target audience, ensuring\n      accuracy without sacrificing readability.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Additionally, the rapid evolution of language, especially in domains like\n      technology and science, poses a continuous challenge for translators. New\n      terms, jargon, and expressions emerge regularly, requiring translators to\n      stay updated and adapt their strategies accordingly. Collaborative efforts\n      between linguists, subject matter experts, and technology developers can\n      help address this challenge by developing glossaries, terminology\n      databases, and translation tools tailored to specific domains.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Leveraging Technology:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In recent years, technology has revolutionized the field of translation,\n      offering powerful tools and resources to enhance efficiency and accuracy.\n      <strong>Machine translation</strong>, powered by artificial intelligence,\n      has made significant strides in translating text between English and\n      Gujarati and other language pairs. While\n      <strong>machine translation</strong> excels at processing large volumes of\n      text quickly, its output may lack the finesse and cultural sensitivity of\n      human translation.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      However, combining <strong>machine translation</strong> with human\n      expertise can yield optimal results. This approach, known as\n      machine-assisted translation or computer-aided translation, harnesses the\n      strengths of both human translators and machine algorithms. Translators\n      can use machine-generated translations as a starting point, refining and\n      polishing the text to ensure linguistic accuracy and cultural\n      appropriateness.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, technology facilitates collaboration and communication among\n      translators, enabling seamless workflows and quality assurance mechanisms.\n      Translation management systems allow multiple translators to work on the\n      same project simultaneously, streamlining the translation process and\n      ensuring consistency across documents.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> serves as a gateway to\n      knowledge, enabling Gujarati speakers to access a wealth of information\n      and opportunities in their native language. By breaking down language\n      barriers, translation promotes inclusivity, fosters cultural exchange, and\n      facilitates global communication.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      While translation presents challenges, advancements in technology and\n      collaborative approaches offer solutions to overcome these obstacles. By\n      leveraging the power of human expertise and artificial intelligence,\n      translators can deliver high-quality translations that preserve the\n      integrity of the original text while catering to the linguistic and\n      cultural needs of the target audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      As our world continues to become more interconnected, the role of\n      translation in bridging linguistic divides becomes increasingly crucial.\n      <strong>English to Gujarati translation</strong> is not just about\n      converting words; it’s about unlocking doors to understanding, empathy,\n      and collaboration across diverse cultures and communities. In this\n      ever-changing landscape, the ability to communicate across languages\n      remains one of humanity’s most valuable assets, transcending borders and\n      enriching lives.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Facilitating Education and Learning</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In today’s interconnected world, proficiency in English is often seen as a\n      gateway to opportunities in education and employment. However, many\n      Tamil-speaking individuals may face challenges in accessing\n      English-language resources due to language barriers.\n      <strong>English to Tamil translation </strong>bridges this gap by making\n      educational materials, including textbooks, online courses, and academic\n      research, available in Tamil. This enables Tamil-speaking students to\n      learn and acquire knowledge in their native language, fostering a more\n      inclusive and equitable education system.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Enhancing Communication and Commerce</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      As businesses expand globally, effective communication with customers,\n      partners, and stakeholders from different linguistic backgrounds becomes\n      essential. <strong>English to Tamil translation</strong> facilitates\n      seamless communication in various sectors, including business, commerce,\n      and tourism. Whether it’s translating marketing materials, product\n      descriptions, or legal documents, accurate translation ensures clarity and\n      understanding across language barriers. Moreover, translating websites and\n      mobile applications into Tamil enhances user experience and accessibility\n      for Tamil-speaking audiences, opening up new markets and opportunities for\n      businesses.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Promoting Cross-Cultural Understanding</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Language serves as a bridge between cultures, facilitating dialogue and\n      fostering mutual understanding.\n      <strong>English to Tamil translation</strong> plays a crucial role in\n      promoting cross-cultural exchange by enabling people from different\n      linguistic backgrounds to engage with each other’s ideas, beliefs, and\n      values. Whether it’s translating news articles, documentaries, or social\n      media content, translation facilitates cultural exchange and empathy,\n      breaking down stereotypes and promoting appreciation for diverse\n      perspectives. Moreover, translation allows Tamil speakers to participate\n      in global conversations on issues ranging from politics and science to\n      arts and entertainment, empowering them to contribute their voices to the\n      global discourse.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Nurturing Linguistic Diversity</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Languages are an integral part of human identity and diversity, reflecting\n      the unique heritage and worldview of communities around the world.\n      Preserving linguistic diversity is essential for maintaining cultural\n      heritage and promoting social cohesion.\n      <strong>English to Tamil translation</strong> contributes to the\n      preservation and revitalization of the Tamil language by ensuring its\n      visibility and relevance in an increasingly English-dominated world. By\n      encouraging bilingualism and multilingualism, translation strengthens\n      linguistic diversity and fosters a more inclusive society where\n      individuals can express themselves in their preferred language without\n      facing discrimination or marginalization.\n    </p>",

By recognizing the importance of\n      translation and investing in language accessibility, we can create a more\n      inclusive and interconnected world where every voice is heard and every\n      culture is celebrated.\n    </p>",

These statistics\n      underscore the importance of offering multilingual content to cater to\n      diverse audiences effectively.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Introducing the Website Translator</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A <strong>website translator</strong> is a tool that automatically\n      converts the content of a website from one language to another in real\n      time. This technology enables businesses to offer their web content in\n      multiple languages without the need for manual translation. By integrating\n      a <strong>website translator</strong> into their online platforms,\n      businesses can provide a seamless browsing experience for users regardless\n      of their language preferences.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Website translators</strong> employ sophisticated algorithms and\n      machine learning techniques to analyze and translate text on web pages.\n      When a user visits a website, the translator detects their preferred\n      language settings and dynamically translates the content into the desired\n      language.

        "<p>\n      In a world that’s increasingly interconnected, the need for effective\n      communication across languages has become more pronounced than ever\n      before. Among the myriad of language pairs,\n      <strong>English to Hindi translation</strong> holds a special significance\n      due to the vast number of speakers of both languages and their cultural\n      influence. Translating from <strong>English to Hindi</strong> isn’t just\n      about converting words; it’s about capturing the essence, nuances, and\n      cultural context inherent in both languages. In this blog post, we delve\n      into the complexities and intricacies involved in\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-hindi-translation/\"><strong>English to Hindi translation</strong></a>, highlighting the challenges, techniques, and importance of maintaining\n      fidelity to the original message while ensuring it resonates with the\n      Hindi-speaking audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Understanding the Linguistic and Cultural Landscape</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      English and Hindi belong to different language families, with English\n      being a Germanic language and Hindi belonging to the Indo-Aryan family.\n      This fundamental difference in linguistic structure and origin poses\n      several challenges when translating between the two languages. English\n      relies heavily on word order and tense for meaning, while Hindi employs a\n      system of grammatical gender, case marking, and verb agreement.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, both languages are deeply rooted in distinct cultural contexts,\n      with English often reflecting Western perspectives and Hindi embodying the\n      cultural nuances of the Indian subcontinent. Translating cultural\n      concepts, idiomatic expressions, and colloquialisms requires not only\n      linguistic proficiency but also cultural sensitivity and awareness.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Challenges in English to Hindi Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Translating from <strong>English to Hindi</strong> involves navigating a\n      multitude of challenges, ranging from differences in vocabulary and syntax\n      to cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions. Here are some of the key\n      challenges translators face:\n    </p>",
        "<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Idiomatic Expressions:</strong> English is replete with\n        idiomatic expressions that may not have direct equivalents in Hindi.\n        Translators must creatively adapt these expressions to convey the\n        intended meaning while maintaining cultural relevance.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cultural Specificity:</strong> Certain cultural references in\n        English may not resonate with Hindi-speaking audiences. Translators need\n        to find culturally appropriate equivalents or provide explanatory notes\n        to ensure comprehension.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Grammatical Differences:</strong> English and Hindi have\n        distinct grammatical structures, particularly concerning verb\n        conjugation, noun declension, and sentence formation. Translators must\n        navigate these differences to produce grammatically correct and\n        natural-sounding translations.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical and Specialized Terminology:</strong> Translating\n        technical, scientific, or specialized content requires a deep\n        understanding of the subject matter and proficiency in both languages to\n        ensure accuracy and clarity.\n      </li>\n</ol>",
        "<p><strong>Techniques for Effective Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Overcoming the challenges inherent in\n      <strong>English to Hindi translation</strong> requires a combination of\n      linguistic expertise, cultural insight, and translation techniques. Here\n      are some strategies employed by translators to achieve effective\n      translations:\n    </p>",
        "<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Transliteration vs. Translation:</strong> Depending on the\n        context, translators may choose between transliterating certain terms or\n        phrases directly from <strong>English to Hindi</strong> or translating\n        them to convey the meaning effectively.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cultural Adaptation:</strong> Adapting cultural references,\n        idiomatic expressions, and metaphors to resonate with Hindi-speaking\n        audiences without compromising the original intent of the text.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintaining Tone and Style:</strong> Preserving the tone, style,\n        and register of the original text while ensuring readability and\n        coherence in the target language.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> Developing a deep\n        understanding of the context, audience, and purpose of the translation\n        to convey the message accurately and effectively\n      </li>\n</ol>",
        "<p><strong>Importance of Accurate Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The significance of accurate translation from\n      <strong>English to Hindi</strong> cannot be overstated, especially in\n      today’s globalized world where communication transcends linguistic\n      barriers. Whether it’s for business, education, entertainment, or\n      diplomacy, accurate translation plays a pivotal role in fostering\n      understanding, fostering cultural exchange, and bridging divides.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In a multicultural and multilingual society like India, where Hindi serves\n      as a lingua franca among speakers of various regional languages, quality\n      translation enables access to information, knowledge, and opportunities\n      for millions of people. From literature and media to legal documents and\n      technical manuals, the impact of accurate translation reverberates across\n      diverse domains, enriching lives and facilitating collaboration across\n      linguistic and cultural boundaries.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>English to Hindi translation</strong> is both an art and a\n      science, requiring translators to navigate linguistic, cultural, and\n      contextual complexities with finesse and precision. As the world becomes\n      increasingly interconnected, the demand for skilled translators proficient\n      in English and Hindi continues to grow.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      By embracing the challenges, employing effective translation techniques,\n      and prioritizing accuracy and cultural sensitivity, translators can bridge\n      linguistic divides, foster cross-cultural understanding, and facilitate\n      meaningful communication between English and Hindi speakers. In doing so,\n      they contribute to the enrichment and empowerment of individuals and\n      communities, transcending borders and fostering a more inclusive and\n      interconnected world.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>What is a Document Translation Agency?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A <strong>document translation agency</strong> is a company that\n      specializes in translating written content from one language to another.\n      These agencies typically employ professional translators who are fluent in\n      multiple languages and have expertise in various subject matters.\n      <strong>Document translation</strong> solutions cover a wide range of\n      materials, including legal documents, medical records, technical manuals,\n      marketing materials, academic papers, and more.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Why are Document Translation Agencies Important?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Accuracy and Quality:</strong> Professional\n      <strong>document translation agencies</strong> ensure accuracy and\n      maintain the integrity of the original content. This is crucial,\n      especially for legal and technical documents where even minor errors can\n      have significant consequences.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Effective translation goes beyond\n      mere word-for-word conversion; it requires understanding the cultural\n      nuances and context of the target audience.\n      <strong>Document translation agencies</strong> employ translators who are\n      familiar with the cultural subtleties of both languages, ensuring that the\n      translated content resonates with the intended audience.\n    </p>",

Industry certifications, such as those from\n      organizations like the American Translators Association (ATA), indicate a\n      translator’s proficiency and expertise.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Assess Quality Assurance Processes:</strong> Inquire about the\n      agency’s quality assurance procedures, such as proofreading, editing, and\n      review processes. A reliable agency will have rigorous quality control\n      measures in place to ensure the accuracy and consistency of translations.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Consider Technology and Tools:</strong> Modern translation\n      agencies leverage technology and translation management systems to\n      streamline the translation process and maintain consistency across\n      projects. Inquire about the tools and technologies used by the agency to\n      ensure efficiency and accuracy.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Review Client Feedback and Testimonials:</strong> Research the\n      agency’s reputation by reading client reviews and testimonials. Positive\n      feedback from satisfied clients is a good indicator of the agency’s\n      reliability and quality of service.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Discuss Pricing and Turnaround Time:</strong> While cost is an\n      important factor, prioritize quality and accuracy over low prices. Request\n      quotes from multiple agencies and compare their pricing, turnaround times,\n      and solution offerings before making a decision.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Communication and Support:</strong> Choose an agency that offers\n      excellent customer support and clear communication throughout the\n      translation process. Accessibility and responsiveness are crucial for\n      addressing any concerns or questions that may arise during the project.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      In today’s interconnected world, where digital borders blur and businesses\n      expand their reach beyond domestic boundaries, the significance of\n      effective communication cannot be overstated. For companies eyeing global\n      expansion, one crucial aspect often overlooked is\n      <strong>website localization</strong>. This is where a proficient\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translation agency</strong></a>\n      steps in, acting as a bridge between businesses and international\n      audiences, facilitating seamless cross-cultural communication.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Understanding the Need</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Imagine stumbling upon a website in a language you don’t understand.\n      Frustrating, isn’t it? Now put yourself in the shoes of a potential\n      customer encountering your non-localized website. The result? High bounce\n      rates, lost leads, and missed revenue opportunities. This scenario\n      illustrates the critical importance of\n      <strong>website localization</strong>.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      While <strong>machine translation</strong> tools offer quick fixes, they\n      often fall short in capturing nuances, idioms, and cultural sensitivities\n      essential for effective communication. A professional\n      <strong>website translation agency</strong> goes beyond mere word-to-word\n      translation, ensuring that the essence of your brand message remains\n      intact while resonating with diverse audiences worldwide.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Tailoring Content for Global Audiences</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A <strong>website translation agency</strong> employs skilled linguists\n      who are not only fluent in the target language but also well-versed in the\n      cultural nuances of the target market. They meticulously adapt content to\n      suit local preferences, ensuring it strikes a chord with the audience.\n      From colloquial expressions to cultural references, every aspect is\n      fine-tuned to create a personalized user experience, fostering trust and\n      engagement.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, localization goes beyond language translation. It encompasses\n      adapting images, colors, and even design elements to align with cultural\n      norms and preferences. By embracing localization, businesses demonstrate\n      respect for diversity and position themselves as culturally sensitive\n      entities, thereby enhancing brand credibility and fostering long-term\n      customer relationships.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Boosting SEO and Visibility</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In the digital realm, visibility is key to success. A professionally\n      translated and localized website not only appeals to users but also\n      enhances search engine visibility in target markets. By incorporating\n      region-specific keywords, meta tags, and alt texts, a\n      <strong>website translation agency</strong> optimizes your site for local\n      search engines, improving its ranking and driving organic traffic.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Furthermore, localized content enhances user engagement metrics such as\n      dwell time, bounce rate, and click-through rate, signaling search engines\n      about the relevance and quality of your website. This positive feedback\n      loop results in improved search engine rankings, ultimately amplifying\n      your online presence and expanding your global footprint.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Navigating Cultural Pitfalls</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Cultural sensitivity is paramount in international communication. What may\n      be acceptable in one culture could be deemed offensive or inappropriate in\n      another. A <strong>website translation agency</strong> acts as a cultural\n      mediator, ensuring that your content respects local norms, values, and\n      sensitivities.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      From avoiding taboo topics to adapting visuals and symbols, linguistic\n      experts navigate potential cultural pitfalls, safeguarding your brand\n      reputation and mitigating the risk of backlash. By investing in\n      professional <strong>website localization</strong> solutions, businesses\n      demonstrate their commitment to cultural understanding and ethical\n      communication, laying a solid foundation for sustainable growth in global\n      markets.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Ensuring Consistency Across Platforms</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In today’s omnichannel landscape, consistency is key to brand identity. A\n      reputable <strong>website translation agency</strong> ensures uniformity\n      across all digital touchpoints, including websites, mobile apps, social\n      media platforms, and e-commerce portals. This cohesive brand experience\n      fosters brand recognition and loyalty, regardless of the user’s language\n      or location.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      By employing robust translation management systems and glossaries,\n      linguistic experts maintain consistency in terminology, tone, and\n      messaging, reinforcing brand integrity and credibility. Whether it’s a\n      product description, a blog post, or a marketing campaign, every piece of\n      content reflects your brand ethos, resonating with audiences worldwide.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In an era of globalization, effective communication transcends linguistic\n      barriers. A <strong>website translation agency</strong> serves as a\n      strategic partner, empowering businesses to unlock new markets, forge\n      meaningful connections, and drive sustainable growth. By embracing\n      <strong>website localization</strong>, businesses demonstrate their\n      commitment to diversity, inclusivity, and cultural understanding, paving\n      the way for global success. As the digital landscape continues to evolve,\n      investing in professional translation solutions isn’t just a choice; it’s\n      a necessity for thriving in today’s interconnected world.\n    </p>",

With the advent of the internet, the world has become more\n      interconnected than ever before, opening up immense opportunities for\n      businesses to tap into markets beyond their borders. However, language\n      barriers remain a significant obstacle in reaching international audiences\n      effectively. This is where a powerful tool like a\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translator</strong></a>\n      comes into play, offering a seamless solution to bridge linguistic divides\n      and unlock global potential.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Breaking Down Language Barriers</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A <strong>website translator</strong> is a tool or solution that enables\n      the automatic translation of web content from one language to another in\n      real-time. By integrating such a tool into a website, businesses can\n      ensure that their content is accessible to speakers of different\n      languages, thereby broadening their audience base and enhancing user\n      experience. Whether it’s a corporate website, an e-commerce platform, a\n      blog, or a news site, a <strong>website translator</strong> can make\n      content available to a global audience with just a few clicks.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Expanding Reach and Increasing Engagement</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The benefits of integrating a <strong>website translator</strong> extend\n      far beyond mere language translation. By making content available in\n      multiple languages, businesses can tap into new markets and attract\n      international customers who might otherwise be deterred by language\n      barriers. This can lead to increased website traffic, higher engagement\n      levels, and ultimately, improved conversion rates.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, offering content in multiple languages demonstrates a commitment\n      to inclusivity and accessibility, which can enhance brand reputation and\n      foster stronger relationships with customers worldwide. Visitors are more\n      likely to trust and engage with a website that speaks their language,\n      leading to greater loyalty and repeat visits.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Improving SEO and Boosting Visibility</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In addition to enhancing user experience, a\n      <strong>website translator</strong> can also have significant benefits for\n      search engine optimization (SEO). By providing translated content,\n      websites can improve their visibility in search engine results pages\n      (SERPs) for queries in different languages, thereby attracting more\n      organic traffic from international markets.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Furthermore, multilingual content can help websites rank higher in local\n      search results, particularly in regions where the primary language differs\n      from the website’s original language. This can give businesses a\n      competitive edge in foreign markets and increase their chances of being\n      discovered by potential customers.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Choosing the Right Website Translator</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      When considering implementing a <strong>website translator</strong>, it’s\n      essential to choose the right tool or solution that aligns with your\n      specific needs and objectives. There are various options available,\n      ranging from free <strong>machine translation</strong> solutions to more\n      advanced solutions with human translation capabilities.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      While <strong>machine translation</strong> tools offer convenience and\n      affordability, they may not always deliver the level of accuracy and\n      nuance required for professional or specialized content. For businesses\n      seeking high-quality translations, opting for a service that combines\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation-api/\"><strong>machine translation</strong></a>\n      with human editing and proofreading can ensure greater precision and\n      linguistic fluency.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Best Practices for Website Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      To maximize the effectiveness of a <strong>website translator</strong>,\n      it’s essential to follow best practices to ensure accurate and culturally\n      appropriate translations:\n    </p>",
        "<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintain Consistency:</strong> Ensure that translated content is\n        consistent in tone, style, and terminology across languages to maintain\n        brand identity and clarity.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consider Cultural Nuances:</strong> Be mindful of cultural\n        differences and nuances when translating content to avoid inadvertently\n        causing offense or misunderstanding.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optimize for SEO:</strong> Translate metadata, URLs, and other\n        elements that contribute to SEO to maximize visibility in international\n        search results.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Regularly Update Content:</strong> Keep translated content\n        up-to-date to reflect changes in products, solutions, or information,\n        ensuring relevance and accuracy for global audiences.\n      </li>\n</ol>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to communicate\n      effectively across languages is essential for businesses looking to expand\n      their reach and connect with diverse audiences.

        "<p>\n      In today’s interconnected global marketplace, businesses are constantly\n      seeking ways to expand their reach and connect with audiences worldwide.\n      With the advent of technology, particularly the internet, reaching a\n      global audience has become more feasible than ever before. However, to\n      truly capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital landscape,\n      businesses must consider the importance of\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translation</strong></a>.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Website translation</strong> involves adapting the content of a\n      website to different languages to make it accessible and appealing to\n      diverse audiences. While the benefits of\n      <strong>website translation</strong> may seem apparent on the surface,\n      delving deeper reveals its profound impact on businesses’ growth,\n      credibility, and overall success.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the primary advantages of <strong>website translation</strong> is\n      the ability to tap into new markets. By making your website available in\n      multiple languages, you can effectively target international audiences,\n      thereby expanding your customer base and increasing revenue streams. This\n      strategic approach allows businesses to overcome language barriers and\n      engage with consumers who may have otherwise been inaccessible.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, <strong>website translation</strong> enhances the credibility\n      and professionalism of a business. When visitors encounter a website that\n      is available in their native language, they are more likely to perceive\n      the brand as trustworthy and committed to catering to their needs. This\n      perception fosters positive relationships with customers, leading to\n      increased loyalty and brand advocacy.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Furthermore, <strong>website translation</strong> is a powerful tool for\n      enhancing search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. By optimizing\n      translated content with relevant keywords in different languages,\n      businesses can improve their visibility in international search engine\n      results. This, in turn, drives organic traffic to their website and boosts\n      their online presence across various markets.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In addition to facilitating customer engagement and improving SEO,\n      <strong>website translation</strong> can also foster cultural sensitivity\n      and inclusivity. By respecting and accommodating linguistic diversity,\n      businesses demonstrate their commitment to embracing different cultures\n      and values. This inclusive approach not only resonates with international\n      audiences but also strengthens the brand’s reputation as socially\n      responsible and culturally aware.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      However, achieving effective <strong>website translation</strong> requires\n      careful planning and execution. Simply translating content word-for-word\n      may result in inaccuracies, misinterpretations, or cultural insensitivity.\n      Therefore, it is essential to enlist the services of professional\n      translators who are not only fluent in the target language but also\n      possess cultural competence and contextual understanding.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, businesses must ensure consistency across all translated content\n      to maintain brand identity and messaging coherence. Implementing a robust\n      translation management system can streamline the process and facilitate\n      collaboration between translators, editors, and content creators. This\n      approach ensures accuracy, quality, and timeliness in delivering\n      translated content to the intended audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Furthermore, ongoing monitoring and analysis of website performance\n      metrics are crucial to measuring the effectiveness of\n      <strong>website translation</strong> efforts. By tracking key indicators\n      such as traffic, engagement, and conversion rates across different\n      language versions, businesses can identify areas for improvement and\n      refine their localization strategies accordingly.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>In conclusion</strong>, <strong>website translation</strong> is an\n      indispensable component of global expansion and digital marketing\n      strategies for businesses seeking to thrive in today’s multicultural\n      landscape. By embracing linguistic diversity, businesses can unlock new\n      opportunities, build trust with international audiences, and strengthen\n      their competitive advantage. As technology continues to evolve and\n      connectivity grows, investing in <strong>website translation</strong> is\n      not just a matter of choice but a strategic imperative for sustainable\n      growth and success in the global marketplace.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      In today’s interconnected world, where businesses transcend geographical\n      boundaries, effective communication across languages is paramount. Nowhere\n      is this more critical than in the field of finance, where accuracy,\n      clarity, and precision are non-negotiable. Enter\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/banking-finance-translation/\"><strong>finance translation</strong></a>\n      – the unsung hero facilitating seamless transactions, enabling global\n      investments, and fostering international collaborations.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Finance translation</strong> encompasses a wide array of\n      documents, including financial statements, annual reports, investor\n      presentations, legal contracts, and regulatory documents. Each of these\n      documents carries intricate details, legal obligations, and nuanced\n      terminology that must be accurately conveyed across languages. Any\n      misinterpretation or error in translation can have far-reaching\n      consequences, jeopardizing investments, legal compliance, and overall\n      business reputation.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      At the heart of <strong>finance translation</strong> lies the need for\n      precision. Financial documents often contain complex numerical data,\n      technical jargon, and legal terminology, making them particularly\n      challenging to translate. A mistranslation of a single term or figure\n      could lead to misunderstandings, financial losses, or even legal disputes.\n      Therefore, <strong>finance translators</strong> must possess not only\n      linguistic proficiency but also a deep understanding of finance and\n      accounting principles.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In the realm of global finance, accuracy is not the only consideration –\n      speed is also of the essence. Markets operate in real-time, and any delay\n      in the translation of financial information could result in missed\n      opportunities or reactive rather than proactive decision-making. Thus,\n      <strong>finance translation</strong>\n      solutions must combine accuracy with efficiency, delivering timely\n      translations without compromising on quality.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Moreover, <strong>finance translation</strong> extends beyond mere\n      language conversion; it involves cultural adaptation as well. Financial\n      norms, regulations, and practices vary from one country to another, and a\n      successful financial translation must bridge these cultural differences.\n      What may be acceptable or customary in one market could be taboo or\n      illegal in another. Therefore, <strong>finance translators</strong> must\n      possess cultural sensitivity and expertise to ensure that the translated\n      documents resonate with the target audience while adhering to local\n      regulations.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      One area where <strong>finance translation</strong> plays a pivotal role\n      is in facilitating cross-border investments. As businesses expand\n      globally, investors seek opportunities in foreign markets, necessitating\n      the translation of financial documents to attract international funding.\n      Whether it’s translating prospectuses for initial public offerings (IPOs)\n      or investor presentations for mergers and acquisitions, accurate\n      translation is crucial in gaining investor confidence and ensuring\n      compliance with regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Furthermore, <strong>finance translation</strong> serves as a cornerstone\n      for regulatory compliance in international finance. With financial\n      regulations evolving rapidly and differing significantly from one country\n      to another, multinational corporations must navigate a complex web of\n      legal requirements. Translating regulatory documents, such as compliance\n      reports, risk assessments, and audit findings, ensures that businesses\n      remain compliant with local laws and regulations, mitigating the risk of\n      fines, penalties, or legal liabilities.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In addition to its instrumental role in international finance,\n      <strong>finance translation</strong> also contributes to fostering\n      transparency and accountability within organizations. By translating\n      financial statements, annual reports, and corporate disclosures, companies\n      demonstrate their commitment to transparency and provide stakeholders with\n      clear insights into their financial performance. Transparent communication\n      builds trust and confidence among investors, creditors, and other\n      stakeholders, strengthening the foundation for sustainable growth and\n      long-term success.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Despite its significance, <strong>finance translation</strong> is often\n      overlooked or undervalued in the broader discourse on globalization and\n      cross-cultural communication. However, its impact on global finance and\n      business operations cannot be overstated. From facilitating cross-border\n      investments to ensuring regulatory compliance and enhancing transparency,\n      <strong>finance translation</strong> serves as a linchpin in the\n      interconnected world of finance.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>In conclusion</strong>, <strong>finance translation</strong> is\n      not merely a linguistic exercise; it is a strategic imperative for\n      businesses operating in today’s globalized economy. As financial markets\n      continue to expand and diversify, the demand for accurate, efficient, and\n      culturally sensitive <strong>finance translation</strong> solutions will\n      only intensify. By recognizing the pivotal role of\n      <strong>finance translation</strong> and investing in quality translation\n      solutions, businesses can unlock new opportunities, mitigate risks, and\n      navigate the complexities of international finance with confidence and\n      success.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      As the gaming community continues to grow and diversify, the importance of\n      breaking language barriers becomes increasingly evident. In this blog\n      post, we explore the significance of\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\">DOTA</a> website\n        translation</strong>\n      and its impact on the game’s global reach.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Global Phenomenon of DOTA</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      From its humble beginnings as a custom map for Warcraft III to its\n      evolution into a standalone blockbuster, <strong>DOTA</strong> has become\n      a cultural phenomenon. The game’s strategic depth, diverse hero roster,\n      and competitive gameplay have attracted players from every corner of the\n      globe. However, with a diverse player base comes a multitude of languages\n      and cultures.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Bridging the Language Gap</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the key challenges for any global game is overcoming language\n      barriers. <strong>DOTA</strong>, being a complex and team-oriented game,\n      relies heavily on effective communication among players. This\n      communication is not limited to in-game interactions but also extends to\n      the game’s online presence, including its official website.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      By investing in <strong>DOTA website translation</strong>, developers can\n      bridge the language gap and create a more inclusive environment for\n      players. A multilingual website ensures that crucial information, updates,\n      and announcements are accessible to a wider audience. This inclusivity\n      fosters a sense of community among players from different linguistic\n      backgrounds, enriching the overall gaming experience.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Expanding Player Base</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The benefits of website translation extend beyond enhancing communication;\n      it directly contributes to the expansion of the\n      <strong>DOTA</strong> player base. When information is available in\n      multiple languages, potential players are more likely to engage with the\n      game. This inclusivity can attract new players who might have been\n      hesitant to join a community where the primary language differs from their\n      own.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Additionally, a translated website makes it easier for existing players to\n      introduce the game to friends and family who may not be fluent in the\n      game’s original language. This word-of-mouth marketing becomes a powerful\n      tool for organic growth, driving the popularity of DOTA even further.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity and Localization</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Effective <strong>website translation</strong> goes beyond simple language\n      conversion. It involves cultural sensitivity and localization, ensuring\n      that the content resonates with players from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n      This may include adapting images, symbols, and idioms to be culturally\n      relevant and avoiding language nuances that may be misunderstood.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Localization enhances the immersive experience of the game, making players\n      feel that <strong>DOTA</strong> is not just a foreign title but a game\n      that understands and respects their cultural context. This cultural\n      sensitivity can foster a deeper connection between the game and its\n      players, leading to increased player loyalty and engagement.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the importance of\n      <strong>website translation</strong> for global titles like\n      <strong>DOTA</strong> cannot be overstated. It is not merely a matter of\n      making information accessible; it is about creating an inclusive and\n      welcoming space for players worldwide. Developers who invest in\n      comprehensive website translation are not only ensuring the continued\n      success of their game but also contributing to the growth and unity of the\n      global gaming community.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In conclusion, <strong>DOTA’s</strong> journey from a Warcraft III mod to\n      a global gaming sensation underscores the significance of overcoming\n      language barriers. <strong>Website translation</strong> is a crucial step\n      in this process, promoting inclusivity, expanding the player base, and\n      fostering cultural understanding. As <strong>DOTA</strong> continues to\n      shape the landscape of online gaming, the commitment to breaking language\n      barriers will remain a key element in its ongoing success.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Key Challenges in Finance Translation:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Terminology Accuracy:</strong> Finance has a unique set of terms\n      and jargon that vary across languages. Maintaining accuracy in translating\n      these terms is a significant challenge to avoid misunderstandings.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Different countries have distinct\n      financial regulations. Translators must be well-versed in the financial\n      laws of both the source and target languages to ensure compliance.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Finance is deeply rooted in\n      culture, and certain concepts may not have direct equivalents in other\n      languages. Translators need to navigate these cultural nuances to convey\n      the intended meaning accurately.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Time Sensitivity:</strong> Financial information is often\n      time-sensitive. Translators must work efficiently to meet deadlines\n      without compromising accuracy.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Best Practices for Finance Translation:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Specialized Translators:</strong> Choose translators with\n      expertise in finance. Their understanding of financial concepts ensures\n      accurate translation and interpretation of documents.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Utilize Technology:</strong> Leverage translation tools and\n      technologies to enhance efficiency and consistency. However, human\n      oversight is crucial to ensure the context is accurately conveyed.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Maintain Consistency:</strong> Establish a glossary of financial\n      terms and phrases to maintain consistency across translations. This is\n      particularly important for businesses with a global presence.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Cultural Consultation:</strong> Work closely with translators who\n      are not only fluent in the languages but also understand the cultural\n      nuances of the target audience. This helps in avoiding misunderstandings\n      that may arise due to cultural differences.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Review by Financial Experts:</strong> Have the translated content\n      reviewed by financial experts who are native speakers of the target\n      language. This extra layer of scrutiny ensures that the financial message\n      is accurately conveyed.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In the interconnected world of finance, effective communication is the key\n      to success. <strong>Finance translation </strong>serves as the bridge that\n      enables seamless communication across borders, facilitating international\n      business transactions and collaborations.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Below are ways in which\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translation/\"><strong>document translation</strong></a>\n      can help you to expand your business.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>1) Gaining customers:</strong> Do you feel good reading the\n      websites and everything related to a company in your language, so that you\n      understand more about it and would like to give it a try, the\n      documentation on your own makes an appeal and urges you to buy it when\n      comparing to others who don’t have proper documentation. Local attracts\n      more audience. Once a local customer starts to trust you then they will\n      become a loyal customer.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>2) International Expansion:</strong> When you are starting a new\n      expansion in another region, first you need to research local markets, the\n      audience, etc.Using <strong>Document Translation </strong>for every region\n      won’t go well with all customers. Make sure you go well with the natives\n      and attract them with local brochures, product descriptions, documents,\n      etc.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>3) Increase in sales and Revenue:</strong> One can increase sales\n      when doing business in a local area by investing in local interest fields,\n      making them feel like their own by adapting to their culture, and needs,\n      and attracting them by making new changes in our products.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>4) Competition:</strong> It is good if you are making a step ahead\n      by introducing local documentation where everyone overlooks it and thinks\n      if our products are good it will reach everyone but never underestimate\n      the customers who like all the products in their native to understand more\n      in-depth about and create interest when it appears in their language.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>5) Cost Effectiveness:</strong> We cannot use the same thing for\n      all the diverse customers as it creates different opinions and to create a\n      particular for every set of audiences uses a lump sum amount along with\n      the time. To cut costs and use time properly documentation came to rescue\n      us where we can change the language and it becomes effective when the\n      audience just clicks in their language.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>6) Legal Issues:</strong> When it comes to some industries like\n      Financial institutions, Hospitals, and related Laws,\n      <strong>Document Translation </strong>should be in the local language as\n      we need to go parallel with local laws. Failure to cope with this\n      sometimes leads to legal issues and more it makes a mark on brand\n      identity.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>7) Optimisation:</strong> When the document is optimized in every\n      local language, it becomes easy for customers to search for it, and in\n      this way, the search engines make a higher rank for your documentation,\n      increasing Google’s rank for your documentation so that it will reach\n      other customers.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Google, Netflix, Amazon, and Iike are the prominent ones who adapt\n      documentation to attract people and increase their popularity to the next\n      step easily by adapting to regional languages in India. Overall to create\n      a long-lasting Brand one should have proper documentation that aligns with\n      natives and to increase loyal customers.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      One of the barriers to reaching globalization’s full potential is the\n      language barrier. Programmers and developers have engaged themselves in\n      research, producing software that allows for the translation of words,\n      voice notes, and web pages into several languages. The<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/translation-api-fast-way-for-content-translation-in-indian-languages/\"><strong> translation API</strong></a>\n      is one example of such software.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      A translation application programming interface (API) is a solution that\n      enables subscribers to include word translation capability in their\n      websites or client apps. This is a simple programming interface designed\n      to recognize and translate text from one language to another.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>How does a translation API work?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Translate APIs use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)\n      to dynamically translate language combinations. APIs allow access to\n      translation data resources, which developers get using the GET request\n      technique.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      APIs that translate are also useful for organizations who want visitors to\n      their website or application end users to be able to translate content\n      into another language. APIs for translation assist businesses that produce\n      language-learning programs as well.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Why is a translation API necessary?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      APIs for translating text are critical tools for speeding up the process\n      of translating text on websites and in applications. Businesses can\n      promote to both new and current clients more effectively. When consumers\n      can learn about products and solutions in their own language, it opens up\n      additional chances for purchasing.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Many APIs handle hundreds of languages, and billions of words, and can\n      recognize the user’s input language automatically. As a result, developers\n      and businesses that serve worldwide audiences benefit from the ease of\n      integrating APIs that translate.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>How Can a Translator API Benefit Your Business?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Am API is a tool that allows businesses to integrate a software interface\n      for machine and human text translation into their product. Such\n      integration will aid in translating website and app content, as well as\n      incoming consumer messages, in seconds. Customer solution representatives\n      will be able to offer a proper and understandable response in the\n      consumer’s language.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      To assist your support staff in producing a meaningful response quickly, a\n      language <strong>translation API</strong> employs machine translation to\n      handle messages from clients in over 5,900 language pairs and human\n      translation in over 110 language pairs. Companies can save money by not\n      hiring multilingual support employees when a single support representative\n      can efficiently close issues in multiple languages.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      From the perspective of software development, the rapid and seamless\n      integration of a translation API saves a significant amount of time that\n      would otherwise be spent establishing such a platform from the ground up.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      With hundreds of translation systems on the market today, businesses may\n      find it challenging to select the best language translator API. A\n      translation API should be considered by every firm that wishes to add\n      multilingual capabilities to their product or provide a more\n      cost-effective customer support solution.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Choosing the best <strong>translation API</strong> for your needs is\n      determined by a number of requirements, including the languages you need\n      to translate and the apps you’ll be working with. Through flexible\n      customization, a feature-rich interface, and simple connection, it helps\n      company owners and enterprises to optimise their internal localization and\n      external translation operations.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      In the past few years, the trends of the Indian entertainment industry\n      have undergone a dynamic transformation. This trend is completely driven\n      by introducing a new player in the entertainment sector i.e. OTT\n      (over-the-top) platforms. These provide customers with a new way to enjoy\n      the content anytime, anywhere by simply using smartphones and an internet\n      connection.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      The most popular ones providing such streams Netflix and Amazon Prime have\n      not only changed how people used to consume the content but also paved the\n      way for a new era in the world of cinema. The most interesting fact is\n      that this revolution is not only limited to India but also has spread on a\n      worldwide scale.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      This implies that the same content or even a storyline has to be delivered\n      to large sections of audiences speaking diverse languages. To cater to\n      such diverse linguistic needs translation activities play a major role.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Let’s understand how such translation activities have increased access and\n      user engagement for a larger section of the audience:\n    </p>",
        "<ol>\n<li><strong>Provides a variety of content</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      Earlier the content was limited due to its steaming language which\n      resulted in dissatisfaction among some people but the emergence of the OTT\n      platforms resulted in an increase in the user engagement rate of the\n      audience. The OTT platforms in India not only provide movies but also\n      offers many different varieties of shows such as web series, podcast, and\n      documentaries. This has led many people to stick to these platforms.\n    </p>",
        "<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Regional content</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      Earlier the cinema was somehow able to give entertainment but without any\n      regional diversity with it. But today, the OTT platforms are successfully\n      able to break these language barriers. These streaming platforms hire\n      translation companies offering professional\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\">DOTA </a>website\n        translation </strong>solutions. This leads to generating content in multiple languages to\n      satisfy the demand of a large number of people around the country.\n    </p>",
        "<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Creative freedom</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      Because of many restrictions in the entertainment sector many of the\n      filmmakers were not able to describe their actual work to the audience.\n      Creating content for OTT platforms has encouraged filmmakers to often have\n      more artistic liberty. This gives them a golden opportunity to experiment\n      with storytelling and handle different and socially important themes.\n    </p>",
        "<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Fresh and new talent</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      Ott led to the beginning of the new revolution in terms of both new talent\n      in front and behind the cameras. Global opportunities were open for\n      artists to showcase their skills and abilities in front of a wider number\n      of people. This has led to the hunt for fresh faces and creative\n      storytelling.\n    </p>",
        "<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Easily accessible </strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      The people before OTT platforms had to go to the cinema or wait for the\n      movie to be released on TV. That was not very convenient for the people.\n      But accessing the content is just like a piece of cake for all the\n      entertainment lovers today only because of the other platforms. People can\n      watch their favorite content anytime, anywhere, and on multiple devices.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Streaming platforms make the content available for the people by taking\n      the help of website translation agencies.\n    </p>",
        "<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Short forms of content</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n      Apart from lengthy feature films and shows, other platforms have\n      encouraged the popularity of short-form content such as mini web series,\n      short TV shows, and even 10-15 min films, that give more variety of\n      content options to the audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Hence, we can conclude that the advent of OTT platforms has not only given\n      new life to the cinema but has also changed the entertainment industry.\n      Providing content to people in their desired language is very important to\n      flourish. <strong>DOTA</strong> <strong>Website translation</strong> is\n      the main reason for this revolution.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In essence, these platforms have not swapped the traditional cinema but\n      have enriched and changed the cinematic experience.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      Expanding your internet presence internationally is becoming a crucial\n      need for businesses and organizations of all sizes in our increasingly\n      linked world. The benefits of\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-translation/\"><strong>website translation</strong></a>\n      are significant and look to be very promising, regardless of whether\n      you’re a huge e-commerce giant or a little local non-profit. We’ll go into\n      the importance of website translation and how it helps create doors for\n      international prospects.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Website translation</strong> involves translating a website’s\n      content from one language to another so that a larger audience may access\n      and understand it. The content must also be carefully modified in addition\n      to the language in order to match the social cues and preferences of the\n      target audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Translation of Websites: Their Importance</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Global Reach – </strong>Making a translation of your website is\n      mostly done to reach out to a global audience. English isn’t spoken by the\n      vast majority of people on the earth, despite being the language used most\n      often online. By translating your website into a few other languages, you\n      can overcome language barriers and make your content available to a wider\n      range of potential visitors and customers.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Cultural Relevance –</strong>\n<strong>Website translation</strong> takes into account culture in\n      addition to understanding language. A great way to increase customer\n      loyalty and trust is to customize your content to the social preferences\n      and opinions of your target audience.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>SEO Benefits</strong>: Search engine optimization (SEO) can\n      benefit from website translation. When your content is available in\n      multiple languages, you have the opportunity to appear higher in search\n      results for terms in those languages. This might bring about additional\n      traffic from clients beyond the country.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Competitive Edge: </strong>Differentiating oneself is essential in\n      today’s brutally competitive internet environment. Offering a translated\n      website may set you apart from rivals who have not adopted this tactic and\n      provide you with a significant edge in international markets.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Income expansion</strong>: Translating a website may enhance\n      income. You have the opportunity to enter new markets and increase sales\n      or donations by catering to the interests and needs of various audiences.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Challenges with website translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Despite the obvious advantages of <strong>website translation</strong>,\n      there are a number of difficulties to overcome:\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Costs: </strong>Translating a website may be expensive,\n      particularly if it has a lot of material. However, the return on\n      investment (ROI) frequently overcomes the upfront cost.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Quality assurance:</strong> It is crucial to guarantee the\n      reliability and excellence of translations. Content that is poorly\n      translated might harm your brand’s reputation and turn off potential\n      consumers.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Why should you hire a website translator?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      An expert translator has the translation expertise and cultural\n      understanding required to successfully communicate your message to a\n      worldwide audience. In order to avoid any potential misunderstandings or\n      offenses, they make sure that your information is appropriately translated\n      and culturally suitable.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Translators are talented in changing words, metadata, and other Web\n      optimization parts to engage specific language markets, expanding the\n      openness of your site in worldwide web crawler results. They maintain the\n      trustworthiness of your image by guaranteeing that the language, tone, and\n      style utilized on your entire site are all in a state of harmony.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Your website’s effectiveness, as well as the reputation and revenue\n      potential of your brand in international markets, are all guaranteed by a\n      skilled translation.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      For organizations and associations who need to flourish in a universally\n      connected world, site interpretation is an essential need. It empowers you\n      to connect with a scope of crowds, help Website design enhancement, get an\n      upper hand, and lastly support income development.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Indeed, even while there might be difficulties when done accurately, the\n      advantages much offset the difficulties. Now is the time to take advantage\n      of the numerous global opportunities that\n      <strong>website translation</strong> offers if you haven’t already.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Financial Education and Literacy Challenges</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Eliminating financial translation may make economic inequalities between\n      nations and regions worse. Without financial translation, financial\n      education and literacy programs would struggle to offer useful materials.\n      It would be challenging for people from non-English-speaking backgrounds\n      to obtain crucial financial information, which would limit their capacity\n      to make wise financial decisions.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Without<strong> finance translation,</strong> only those who speak English\n      could fully comprehend the world’s financial markets. This would add to a\n      knowledge gap where only a small number of people have access to the\n      enormous richness of financial information, sustaining economic inequities\n      and impeding the growth of the global economy.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Compromised International Investments</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Investors would only have limited access to financial reports and\n      disclosures in their mother tongues in the absence of financial\n      translation. Because of the diminished transparency, investors would be\n      discouraged from investing and the markets may become unstable. Investors’\n      ability to diversify across geographies and sectors would be restricted if\n      they were only allowed to invest in markets where they could understand\n      the financial information. This restriction could lead to subpar\n      portfolios and increased sensitivity to market changes.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      The absence of <strong>finance translation</strong> would be extremely\n      detrimental to emerging markets. The economic expansion of these markets\n      frequently depends on foreign investment. Foreign investors would be\n      deterred by the lack of readily available financial information in\n      numerous languages, which would impede economic growth in these areas and\n      exacerbate global economic imbalances.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>International interruption of trade</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Financial translation is necessary for businesses to understand contracts,\n      agreements, and financial reports in foreign markets, and their absence\n      would immediately result in a lack of clarity in financial papers.\n      Companies mainly rely on these translations when entering new markets.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      If financial translation were to disappear, businesses would be more\n      vulnerable when they enter new markets.

        "<p>\n      The variety of materials available in the Marathi entertainment market is\n      one of the main factors contributing to its expansion. The era in which\n      family dramas and regional themes predominated in Marathi film and\n      television is long gone.

        "<p>\n      Regarding how much they cost, Machine translation APIs are a cheaper\n      alternative to traditional methods of manual translation. Their low cost\n      allows businesses, even those with limited funds, to connect with people\n      worldwide.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Scalability for Growing Enterprises</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Because Machine translation APIs can be scaled up or down, they can be\n      used by businesses of all kinds. This ability to grow is especially\n      helpful for companies that are growing quickly and need more and more\n      translation. It lets them avoid worrying about needing more resources.\n    </p>",

In the future, APIs can handle multiple\n      languages, figure out how sentences are put together, and translate in\n      real time. This shift in thinking will make it easier for people worldwide\n      to talk to each other, even if they speak different languages.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The internet has expedited corporate growth and globalised our economy,\n      thus it is only logical that the translation process has changed over\n      time. The value of <strong>document translation</strong> must be taken\n      into account in the current global corporate environment. It has become\n      crucial for businesses to communicate successfully with clients and\n      partners that speak multiple languages as they expand their reach across\n      boundaries. Translate Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or PDF files into more than\n      70 different languages.\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translation/\"><strong>Document translation</strong></a>\n      was created especially for translating huge files with rich content.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Only with a procedure that is equally as cutting-edge as the present\n      operational standards of the sector can the advantages of translation\n      solutions be fully realised.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>International Communication is Made Easier</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The fact that <strong>document translation</strong> makes it easier to\n      communicate internationally is one of its most important benefits. It is\n      essential to comprehend a person’s language and culture while\n      communicating with people from other nations, whether it be for business,\n      government, or personal reasons. Translation of documents makes it\n      possible to communicate clearly and accurately across language barriers.\n      Businesses can reach new markets and governments can engage with\n      international officials and residents more readily by translating their\n      paperwork.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Procedure openness</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Finding and combining all the numerous assignments into one place used to\n      be one of the main challenges project managers had to face. That project\n      manager can simply determine exactly where everything is in the pipeline\n      thanks to an end-to-end platform. Additionally, they are proactively\n      informed of problems so they may address them right away.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increasing Information Access</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Access to information is also improved via\n      <strong>document translation</strong>. Information is easily accessible\n      online in today’s globalised society, yet it frequently comes in languages\n      that people struggle to read or comprehend. By translating documents,\n      people can gain access to knowledge on a variety of subjects, such as\n      health, education, and business. Making papers accessible to those who\n      don’t speak the same language helps to preserve cultural knowledge and\n      historical information.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Promotes Business Growth</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Business expansion into new markets can be facilitated through\n      <strong>document translation</strong>. Businesses can enhance sales by\n      translating marketing materials, product information, and customer support\n      documentation. Additionally, firms can guarantee that they comply with\n      local rules and regulations when entering new markets by translating legal\n      papers like contracts.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increased return on investment</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Only with an end-to-end platform is it possible to track the value of\n      initiatives. The project manager may see tasks and break down each task’s\n      cost in detail. For instance, they might assess the cost of updating\n      product manuals to include Spanish and assess how well it was received.\n      They can then compare the outcomes across other languages using those\n      results. As a result, the management can decide using data where to best\n      distribute translation budgets and cut back on wasteful spending.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Security</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The biggest issue with old translation methods was security flaws. It was\n      simple to lose track of the numerous files that were continually being\n      transmitted to various recipients, printed off, and stored in various\n      locations. The risk of a breach is greatly reduced by keeping all content\n      inside a single system. Well-designed platforms go one step further by\n      preventing sensitive data from ever leaving the system by restricting who\n      can download material to just important individuals.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Today’s businesses depend heavily on\n      <strong>document translation</strong> to efficiently communicate with\n      clients and partners that speak diverse languages and cultures.\n    </p>",

Additionally,\n      businesses use e-Courses to provide their employees with standardized\n      training programs.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Communicate easily</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The ability to actually communicate with potential clients is probably the\n      most obvious advantage of having translation solutions close at hand.\n      Consider your company as a man in a pub for single people.

The top seven Indian languages to consider for website conversion in\n      2023 are as follows:\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Hindi:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      To maximize their reach and influence in today’s global marketplace, firms\n      must reach out to customers in their native language. With more than 600\n      million Hindi speakers globally, Hindi ranks third. Translating your\n      website into Hindi can help your business expand and reach a large\n      Hindi-speaking audience.

When potential buyers search for a\n      product or service in Hindi, they will be able to reach your website more\n      easily.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Bengali:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Bengali is India’s second most frequently spoken language. The Bengali\n      language and its dialects have slightly diverse ways of conveying a few\n      things; it is far more involved than just translating word for word.\n      Translating your website is not a risky thing to undertake, whether it is\n      to increase your customer base, establish trust in your current client\n      list, or boost your website SEO. It has no chance of resource failure.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Marathi:</strong></p>",
        "<p>Every entrepreneur needs to extend their firm at some point.</p>",
        "<p>\n      If the time has come for you to expand and appeal to Marathi speakers,\n      ensure that your website is translated. Individuals buy for a variety of\n      reasons. They might want your products, or they might enjoy your\n      messaging, design, packaging, or customer solution.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong style=\"letter-spacing: 0px\">Website Translation: Its Importance</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      Catering to a multilingual audience is crucial as the internet brings\n      together people from different linguistic backgrounds. By speaking to\n      potential customers in their own languages, websites can help businesses\n      build relationships with them that promote inclusivity, engagement, and\n      trust. It eliminates linguistic barriers, improves user experience, and\n      reveals a dedication to catering to a diverse customer base.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Benefits of Website Translation</strong></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li><strong>Increasing Global Impact</strong></li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses can reach new customers and seize global opportunities by\n      translating their websites into several different languages. In order to\n      forge a strong connection with target audiences, content should be\n      localised to reflect cultural preferences, idioms, and customs. Businesses\n      can effectively communicate their brand message, develop credibility, and\n      gain a competitive edge in international markets thanks to\n      <strong>Website Translator</strong>.

A localised website makes it easier for users\n      to access the information they need, browse products, and complete\n      transactions by minimising linguistic barriers and reducing confusion.\n      This increases client satisfaction, promotes return visits, and increases\n      conversion rates.\n    </p>",

Businesses can improve their online\n      visibility for local search engines and increase their visibility in\n      foreign markets by translating their web pages, meta tags, and keywords.\n      Businesses can target particular words and phrases with the help of\n      multilingual SEO strategies, bringing in relevant traffic from queries in\n      various languages. Due to more people actively searching for goods and\n      solutions in their native languages, this increases the likelihood of\n      showing up in search engine results pages.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      E-learning is a flexible educational method that utilizes the Internet.\n      Across all educational levels, including K–12, higher education, exam\n      preparation, and informal learning, there are an increasing variety of\n      online learning platforms. The Indian e-learning sector is somewhat\n      fragmented, with only a few specialized companies operating in different\n      niches and numerous start-ups gradually gaining traction with cutting-edge\n      products with the help of\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/elearning-translation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eLearning Translation</a></strong>.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Over the past ten years, e-learning has benefited from technical\n      developments. These include the incorporation of information and\n      communications technology (ICT) into educational settings, the usage of\n      cloud-based platforms, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR).\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong style=\"letter-spacing: 0px\">History of e-learning</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      The fast expansion of internet connectivity and\n      <strong>eLearning Translation</strong> over the past few years has been a\n      significant driver of eLearning in India’s development. This should\n      accelerate adoption further along with the declining cost of smartphones\n      and data, which has seen smartphone penetration rise to 29% in urban\n      regions as of December 2017 and to 72% in rural areas as of September\n      2017.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>2021</strong> provides information on the expanding reliance of\n      the Indian educational sector on the Internet, which is connected to the\n      growth of the eLearning market. According to this study, the rise of\n      online searches for educational reasons climbed by two times in the last\n      two years, while the number of searches made on mobile devices increased\n      by three times. As professionals in corporate organizations want to\n      upskill themselves and choose online certification, these reports are\n      crucial for the eLearning business. The two largest areas, reskilling and\n      online certification, were each worth over $93 million in 2016 and are\n      expected to grow to $463 million by 2021.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Nevertheless, despite the huge reservoir of educated talent this nation\n      needs to hire more than 160 million trained workers. This is due to the\n      fact that the education system in India is unable to provide students with\n      the software skills that the sector demands.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>COVID-19’s effects</strong>:</p>",
        "<p>\n      In-person classes were stopped following the pandemic in order to stop the\n      virus from spreading. However, none foresaw it having such a significant\n      effect. In order to continue learning, institutions are introducing\n      e-learning methodologies and converting to online classes. Due to the\n      closing of educational institutions, there was a 40% to 50% fall in the\n      demand for academic books.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      India’s need for internet services has risen over time as a result of the\n      availability of more affordable cell phones in the country. This has\n      raised a demand for Internet and eLearning Translation, especially in\n      educational content, in both urban and rural areas.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Benefits Of E-Learning</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In Education, E-learning has numerous advantages over traditional learning\n      and is a very effective tool for teaching and training. One benefit of\n      eLearning is that through courses tailored to their needs, it can assist\n      employees in accelerating their professional development.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Employees can learn whenever and wherever they want as long as they have\n      an internet connection, which can also save them time-consuming trips.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      As they may learn at their own pace from the convenience of their homes,\n      employees can utilize their free time effectively. Compared to in-person\n      instruction, eLearning is far more affordable and practical.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong style=\"letter-spacing: 0px\">Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Due to the expansion of the online education sector and its quantitative\n      result of increasing employment prospects, eLearning has been considered a\n      potential game-changer in the next few years, closing the demand-supply\n      gap in Indian industries.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      You can organize a user-friendly learning platform with the aid of\n      eLearning. Because it provides the best of both worlds—lecture and\n      hands-on training—it has a solid reputation. You can increase student\n      satisfaction through eLearning by offering more dynamic and captivating\n      courses.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      International business is common in the world we live in now, which is\n      very linked. Companies need more accurate and reliable financial\n      translation solutions as they do more business outside their home\n      countries. In this piece, we will discuss how important\n      accurate <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/banking-finance-translation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">finance translation</a></strong> is in foreign business and why businesses must choose the right\n      finance translation.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Understanding Translation in Finance?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Finance translation</strong> is putting financial papers like\n      yearly reports, financial accounts, and business documents into a target\n      language. The process calls for a deep understanding of financial terms\n      and ideas, language skills, and knowledge of other cultures. It is a very\n      specialized area that needs people skilled in business and language.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Why is Accurate Finance Translation Important?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses can lose a lot of money if their finances are not translated\n      correctly. Misunderstandings or mistakes in financial papers can lead to\n      wrong understandings of financial facts, wrong values, and problems with\n      following the law. These mistakes can hurt a company’s finances, its\n      image, and even its ability to do business in some areas. So, for\n      businesses to effectively share financial information with partners who\n      may speak different languages, they need correct <strong>finance translation.</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>The Importance of Cultural Awareness in Finance Translation</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      Another important part of finance translation is being aware of cultural\n      differences. It’s not enough to translate financial papers word for word\n      because small differences in culture can greatly affect how financial\n      information is understood. For example, different countries may have\n      different meanings for certain financial terms, and not considering these\n      differences can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. Finance\n      interpreters need to know a lot about the target society to ensure that\n      financial papers are translated and understood correctly.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>The Role of Technology in Finance Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Technology has changed the <strong>finance translation</strong> business in a big way. For example, new tools and apps have come\n      out to help interpreters do their jobs. For example, machine translation\n      is becoming increasingly popular, and some businesses use it to translate\n      financial papers cheaply. But while computer translation can be useful for\n      some types of papers, like emails or notes, it isn’t quite good enough yet\n      to handle financial records that are more complicated. Because of this,\n      companies need to work with financial translation solutions that use both\n      technology and human knowledge to ensure that texts are correct and\n      reliable.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>The Benefits of Working with a Professional Finance Translation\n        Provider</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses can benefit from working with a professional <strong>finance translation</strong> company. For one thing, it ensures that financial papers are\n      translated and understood correctly, making mistakes and misunderstandings\n      less likely to happen. Also, it gives companies more time and money to\n      focus on what they do best instead of spending time and money translating\n      financial papers. Professional finance translation agencies also have the\n      knowledge and tools to deliver high-quality versions quickly. This helps\n      businesses share financial information in a fast and effective way.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Ultimately, it is important for companies that do business worldwide to\n      have an accurate<strong> financial translation</strong>. It lets\n      companies share financial information with their clients in different\n      languages and makes sure they follow local rules. When choosing a finance\n      translation solution, companies should put accuracy, speed, and experience\n      at the top of their lists to ensure that their financial papers are\n      translated with the highest quality and accuracy.  \n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      By choosing the right finance translation agency, companies can reduce the\n      risks of bad texts and improve their business worldwide. With accurate and\n      reliable financial translation, businesses can reach more customers and\n      enter new markets, leading to long-term success and growth.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      In today’s global market, having a website in more than one language is\n      required. <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Website</strong> <strong>Localization</strong></a> is necessary if you want to connect with people in India. However,\n      how can businesses make sure that their translation efforts are paying\n      off? This piece will discuss some of the best ways to localize a website.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conducting Market Research</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Before starting to localize a website, studying the market is essential.\n      This means looking at the target market’s language, cultural details, and\n      tastes. It is important to remember that not all countries and languages\n      are the same, and what works for one may not work for another. This\n      information can help guide the translation process and ensure the website\n      is made for the right people.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Market research can be done with polls, focus groups, or by looking at how\n      many people visit a website. It can help companies understand the local\n      competition, market trends, and cultural faux pas or taboos that could\n      hurt the brand’s image.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Collaborating With Local Experts</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      It is essential to work with local experts to understand the target\n      market. These experts can explain things about the culture that people\n      from outside the culture might need help understanding right away. They\n      can also help translate languages to ensure the website’s messages are\n      clear and compelling.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses can also avoid costly mistakes when they work with area\n      experts. For example, a company’s name may include a color prohibited in\n      the target society. By working with local experts, companies can ensure\n      that the way their websites look and what they say is proper for the\n      culture of their customers.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Implementing a Streamlined Localization Process</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses should use a simplified translation method to make <strong>website localization</strong> as quick and easy as possible. Localization tools could make some\n      of the translation and content-creation processes easier. It could also\n      mean making a normal process that can be used in different languages and\n      countries.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Translation management systems (TMS) and content management systems (CMS)\n      are two types of software that can help with\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/everything-you-should-know-about-website-localization/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website localization</a></strong>. (CMS). These tools can help simplify the translation process, handle\n      the localization processes, and ensure everything is the same across\n      different languages and countries.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Setting up a common way to localize a website helps ensure the process\n      goes as quickly and smoothly as possible. This could mean making a\n      translation style guide that explains the company’s brand voice, tone,\n      messaging, and special rules for different languages and countries.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Continuously Monitoring and Adapting.</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localizing a website is something you do only once, and then you’re done.\n      Businesses should monitor the localization efforts and make changes as\n      needed to ensure the website stays useful. This could be done by looking\n      at your website’s data to see which parts are most popular in different\n      areas or by asking customers in other languages for comments.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      By keeping an eye on website data, businesses can see which pages are\n      doing well and which ones aren’t. Then, they can use this knowledge to\n      improve the website for different languages and areas. For example, if a\n      page about a specific product is popular in a particular area, the\n      business could consider making materials tailored to that region.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Businesses can also find out about problems with their website by asking\n      customers for feedback in different languages. This could mean making\n      polls or other ways for people to give input tailored to different\n      languages and cultures. \n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Website translation</a> </strong>is an essential part of doing business nationally. Businesses can improve\n      their website localization efforts and connect better with customers in\n      different parts of India. This can be achieved through thorough market\n      research, working with local experts, implementing a simplified\n      translation process, and constantly watching and making changes. By doing\n      this, they can improve the image of their business, reach more customers,\n      and sell more.\n    </p>",

It means changing a product or service to fit a\n      specific country or area’s cultural, language, and legal needs. In today’s\n      international world, companies that want to enter new markets or grow\n      their customer base need to localize their products more and more. In this\n      piece, we will discuss the top 6 benefits of localizing a product in more\n      depth.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increased Sales</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the most important perks of localizing a product is increasing\n      sales. By changing a product to fit the local culture and language,\n      companies can make it more appealing and easy for the target audience.\n      This can lead to more people knowing about the company, customer\n      involvement, and, ultimately, more sales. Localizing a product can also\n      help a business stand out from its rivals by offering a unique and\n      appealing value.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Improved User Experience</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localizing a product also improves the user experience by giving users\n      information that is easy to understand and fits their needs. This can\n      include converting product instructions, support papers, and other\n      materials into the local language and changing the product’s user\n      experience to fit local practices and standards. By improving the user\n      experience, companies can make customers happier and more loyal, leading\n      to return business and good word-of-mouth recommendations.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Better Customer Satisfaction</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Customers are likelier to be happy buying if they think the product fits\n      their wants.<strong> Product localization</strong> can help\n      businesses build customer trust by showing they understand and care about\n      their unique needs and tastes. This can make customers happier, more\n      loyal, and more likely to tell others about your business.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Product localization can also give companies an edge in a crowded market\n      by making their products stand out. By learning about the local culture\n      and language, businesses can make sure their marketing messages and\n      products meet the needs of their target audience. This can help them bring\n      in new customers and build a loyal following.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localizing products can also give companies an edge by helping them stand\n      out in a crowded market. Businesses can ensure their marketing words and\n      products meet the needs of their target audience if they know the local\n      culture and language. This could help them stand out from their\n      competitors and bring in new customers. In addition, when companies\n      localize their goods, they can reduce the chance of cultural mistakes and\n      miscommunications, which can hurt their brand’s image.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Lower Costs</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Product localization </strong>takes an early investment, but\n      it can save businesses money in the long run. Companies can save time and\n      money by reducing the risk of product recalls or legal disputes caused by\n      costly mistakes caused by cultural misunderstandings or language problems.\n      In addition, when businesses localize their goods, they can spend less\n      money on marketing efforts to break down artistic or language divides.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increased Global Reach</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Lastly, localizing a product lets a business reach customers outside its\n      home market and confidently enter new markets. Companies can join new\n      markets with a better understanding of the local culture, language, and\n      rules if they change their goods to meet local needs. This can help them\n      gain a strong market foothold, gain loyal customers, and expand their\n      global reach.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In conclusion, companies that want to reach more customers, make more\n      sales, and set themselves apart from their competitors need to localize\n      their products. By putting money into product translation, companies can\n      improve the user experience, make customers happier, give themselves a\n      competitive edge, cut costs, and reach more people worldwide. <strong>Product localization</strong> may take a significant investment upfront but can pay off in the\n      long run. This makes it a good idea for businesses of all kinds and in all\n      industries.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      In today’s globalized environment, companies cannot stress enough how\n      important localization is. With the advent of e-commerce and online\n      communication, reaching out to consumers in their language and cultural\n      background is becoming increasingly necessary. Businesses may do this\n      with <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website localization</a>,</strong> which lets them adjust their content to the local market and\n      improve the user experience. In this post, we will look at the top 5\n      commercial advantages of localization in greater depth.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increased Reach and Market Penetration</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localization may help firms reach more people and go deeper into more\n      markets. This is one of the most evident <strong>benefits of localization</strong>. Localizing your website’s material can ensure your message is clear and\n      relevant to your target audience. This will make it simpler for your\n      audience to understand and interact with your brand. This is especially\n      critical for firms that want to grow into new areas where linguistic and\n      cultural barriers may be significant problems.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Improved User Experience</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Another essential benefit of localization is that it may improve the user\n      experience for people in various parts of the world. You can ensure\n      customers feel appreciated and understood by providing material that fits\n      their requirements and tastes. This might include language and currency\n      choices for marketing campaigns and product descriptions that fit local\n      cultures and tastes.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increased Sales and Revenue</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localization may also lead to more sales and income, another crucial\n      advantage. By making your website easier for people in various parts of\n      the world to use and more enjoyable, you may reach new markets and\n      increase sales. This is especially crucial for firms with a lot of\n      competition, and even a tiny increase in market share may make a\n      significant impact.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Enhanced Brand Image and Reputation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Localization can also improve how people see and think of your brand.\n      Customers will be more likely to trust and believe you if you demonstrate\n      that you understand and appreciate the local culture and language. This\n      may be especially significant for banking, health care, and legal\n      solutions organizations, where trust and reputation are vital.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n       By localizing your website and marketing materials for other\n      markets, you can show that you understand local conventions and legal\n      systems and develop confidence with new customers. This may make people\n      more aware of and loyal to your brand, leading to more recommendations and\n      repeat business.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Lastly, the<strong> benefits of localization</strong> provide\n      firms that sell to customers worldwide with a competitive edge. By\n      providing localized content and solutions, you may set yourself apart from\n      your competition and become a leader in your field. This is essential for\n      firms in areas with a lot of competition because even little increases in\n      market share can make a significant impact.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n       By making separate versions of your software for different parts of\n      the world, you may stand out from rivals with one answer for everyone.\n      This might offer you an edge over your competitors in such areas and help\n      you get a significant portion of the market.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In today’s worldwide world, companies need to be able to contact clients\n      in their own language and cultural environment. <strong>Website localization </strong>may assist by adapting the content to the local market and ensuring users\n      have a better experience. Localization has evident advantages, such as a\n      wider reach, more market penetration, better user experience, more sales\n      and income, better company image and reputation, and a competitive edge.\n      By investing money into localizing their websites, companies may reach new\n      markets, create confidence and credibility with consumers, and,\n      ultimately, expand their enterprises.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Using AI-savvy<strong> translation software</strong> is also\n      helpful because it can make translations more accurate. Translation\n      software uses algorithms to ensure that translations are as accurate as\n      possible.

This makes it a handy and flexible tool for businesses of all\n      sizes, as it can help them grow without paying a lot or lowering the\n      quality of their work.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Improved Customer Satisfaction</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Aside from these benefits, translation software can also help businesses\n      improve how they talk to customers and business partners. Companies can\n      better serve their customers worldwide by making content available in\n      multiple languages.\n    </p>",

        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Precise translations:</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Every translation has to be accurate. A minor mistake can change the whole\n      meaning of the content, and your business could lose credibility. Based on\n      the type of content, translations can be straightforward or complicated.\n      Professional language translation companies focus on translating the\n      content into the target language and follow other requirements to confirm\n      that the spelling, symbols, punctuation, and grammar are correct. The\n      accuracy of the content should not get compromised.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Localization:</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      When entering a new market, translating your content is not enough. To\n      suit the local culture, you need to localize the document. Localization\n      ensures that the content aligns with all dimensions of a project with the\n      preferences of the target market, including design, colors, images, time,\n      date, currency, and all other features because translators from a\n      professional <strong>language translation company</strong> will be\n      well-versed in the native language and understand the culture and liking\n      of the target audience.\n    </p>",

An experienced\n      <strong>language translation company</strong> can work as an incredible\n      marketing resource to step-up your marketing techniques and ideas. With\n      expert knowledge, you can get the ability to target your potential clients\n      effectively. These people will make content appropriate for the cultural\n      preferences of the areas your business targets.\n    </p>",

You will have a\n      dedicated team that includes a project manager, translators, proofreaders,\n      and other helping members to deliver your project error-free. You will get\n      timely updates from the project manager about the progress and address any\n      concerns you may have during the process.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Translation companies use advanced technology:</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n      Professional language translation companies have various computer-aided\n      translation (CAT) tools to aid with projects. The CAT tools make it easier\n      to run large projects efficiently by creating standardized terminology\n      databases, aggregating glossaries for uniformity, and separating the text\n      into translatable units.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Industry specifics are addressed:</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n      Working with an expert\n      <strong>language translation company</strong> specializing in your\n      industry allows you to get assured that your project team understands the\n      unique nuances and terminology of your field. For example, say you want to\n      localize an e-learning course, then you need a translator working within\n      learning management systems that can integrate all aspects of the course.\n      A general translator can translate words from one language to another, but\n      they won’t grasp the intricacies of e-learning.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      One of the best decisions you can make for your business is to enter into\n      new markets with the help of a professional\n      <strong>language translation company</strong>. The quality of the work you\n      will receive with experts is unsurpassed. The process will be affordable,\n      efficient, and seamless. You and your company will join a dedicated team\n      that only wants to provide you with the translation and localization\n      expertise you need.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The legal system is a complicated and nuanced field that needs accuracy\n      and attention to detail to ensure that everyone gets fair treatment and\n      justice. Accurate <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">legal translation</a></strong> is vital because it provides that everyone involved in a case, no\n      matter what language they speak, can understand what is going on and make\n      intelligent decisions. In this article, we’ll talk about how important it\n      is for<strong> legal translations</strong> to be correct, what\n      happens when they aren’t, and what steps should be taken to ensure they\n      are right.\n    </p>",
        "<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Why Accurate Legal Translation Matters?</strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n      Accurate <strong>legal translation</strong> is crucial because\n      even small mistakes can have significant effects. Misinterpretations or\n      bad translations can lead to misunderstandings and bad communication,\n      leading to unfair or unjust results. For example, if a contract or legal\n      document is not translated correctly, the terms and conditions could be\n      misunderstood. This could lead to one party being taken advantage of. This\n      can cause you to lose money, get in trouble with the law, or even be\n      charged with a crime.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Accurate <strong>legal translation </strong>is also necessary to\n      ensure everyone involved in a case has the same access to information.\n      This is especially important if one of the parties needs to speak the\n      language used in the court case. Without accurate translation, they would\n      be at a disadvantage and might not fully understand their actions or\n      decisions. This can lead to a trial that isn’t fair and could be against\n      human rights.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Accurate legal translation also requires cultural sensitivity. Different\n      cultures have very different legal systems and terms, and a translator\n      must be able to understand and communicate these differences. For example,\n      the idea of power of attorney differs in some cultures. A translator must\n      be aware of these differences and be able to explain them correctly. Some\n      legal terms may not even exist in some cultures, so the translator has to\n      develop a suitable replacement to preserve the meaning.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quality Control</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      A thorough quality control is needed to ensure that legal translations are\n      correct. This includes using legal translators who are trained and have\n      experience and who know the legal terms and ideas used in the language\n      pair they are working with. Also, it’s essential to have a second\n      translator check the translation for accuracy and consistency and have a\n      lawyer or other legal expert look over the translation. Reviewing the text\n      more than once can help catch any mistakes or inconsistencies the first\n      translator might have missed.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technology Advancements</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Technology has made a big difference in legal translation in the last few\n      years. Tools that use machine learning and neural networks to translate\n      have been made to help translators do their jobs. By suggesting legal\n      terms and phrases, these tools help ensure that legal translations are\n      consistent and correct. But it’s important to remember that these tools\n      shouldn’t be used alone.

        "<p>\n      The legal system needs to be fair and just so that <strong>legal translations</strong> are correct. It lets everyone involved in a case understand what is\n      going on and make decisions based on what they know, no matter what\n      language they speak.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      To make sure that a legal translation is correct, there needs to be a\n      thorough quality control process that includes using trained and\n      experienced legal translators, multiple reviews, legal knowledge, and\n      sensitivity to different cultures.  \n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      With the development of technology, tools that use machine learning and\n      neural networks to translate can help, but they shouldn’t take the place\n      of human translators.

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      In our globalized world, eLearning has become an important way for people\n      to learn new things and improve their skills. However, learners may not be\n      able to access educational content because of language barriers. That is\n      where <strong>eLearning translation </strong>comes in. It lets\n      learners access learning materials in their language. For\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/elearning-translation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eLearning translation</a></strong>\n      to work well, it is important to follow some best practices. In this\n      article, we will discuss the six best ways to translate eLearning in more\n      depth.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Work with Professional Translators</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n      Quality <strong>eLearning translation</strong> starts with\n      working with professional translators who know a lot about\n      <strong>eLearning translation</strong>. Professional translators are\n      fluent in the language they are translating into and know much about the\n      terms used in eLearning materials. They can ensure that the translated\n      content is correct and conveys the message well. Professional translators\n      can also advise on how to explain ideas and concepts to the target\n      audience in the best way.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Translation Memory</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Translation memory is a tool that saves content that has already been\n      translated and suggests translations for content that is similar. It\n      ensures that all the translated content uses the same terms and language.\n      Using a translation memory can save time and money when translating\n      eLearning content, especially when there is a lot of it. Translation\n      memory can also help ensure that the terms and language used in different\n      courses are the same. This is especially important for students who are\n      taking more than one course.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Test the Translated Content with Native Speakers</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n      A very important part of the <strong>eLearning translation</strong> process has native speakers test the translated content. Native\n      speakers are the best ones to review the content and ensure it is correct\n      and easy to understand. They can find any mistakes or cultural differences\n      that might have been missed when translating the text. This step helps\n      ensure that the content is right for the audience and fits their culture.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Incorporate Cultural Adaptation</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n      It is important to include cultural adaptation to ensure that the\n      translated content is culturally relevant and appropriate for the target\n      audience. Adapting the translated content to the target audience’s culture\n      means changing it. This process involves knowing how the cultures of the\n      source language and the target language are different and changing the\n      content to fit those differences. By considering cultural differences,\n      <strong>eLearning translation</strong> can be more effective and make it\n      easier for learners to understand the content.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Visual Aids</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Visual aids like pictures and videos are good ways to explain complicated\n      ideas and concepts in eLearning materials. No matter what language a\n      learner speaks, visual aids in <strong>eLearning translation</strong> can\n      help them understand the content better. Visual aids can also help\n      learners who do not speak the same language and learn differently\n      understand the material. Using visual aids in\n      <strong>eLearning translation</strong> can improve the learning experience\n      and help people learn more.\n    </p>",
        "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Maintain Consistency</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n      Consistency in translated content is critical, especially when there is\n      much content to translate. Consistency ensures that the content that has\n      been translated is clear and that there are no differences in the message\n      being sent. It is important to use the same terms and language throughout\n      the translated content so that people can easily understand it. Using a\n      style guide and regular quality assurance checks on the translated content\n      can help keep things consistent.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>E-learning translation</strong> is an important tool for\n      breaking down language barriers in education. By following these best\n      practices, you can ensure that\n      <strong>eLearning translation</strong> works well, leading to better\n      learning outcomes.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      For eLearning translation, the six best practices are to use professional\n      translators, use translation memory, test the translated content with\n      native speakers, including cultural adaptation, use visual aids, and stay\n      consistent.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      As eLearning continues to grow in popularity, eLearning translation will\n      become more important to make sure that all learners, no matter what\n      language they speak, have equal access to education.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The digital finance and fintech industry is rapidly growing and expanding\n      globally, as more and more consumers and businesses turn to online\n      platforms for financial solutions. As this industry continues to evolve,\n      the importance of translation and localization becomes increasingly clear.\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/banking-finance-translation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Finance Translation</a></strong>\n      and localization are essential for ensuring that digital finance and\n      fintech products and solutions are accessible and understandable for all\n      users, regardless of their language or location.\n    </p>",

        "<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>\n<strong>Accessibility for Non-Native Speakers:</strong> One of the main\n        reasons why <strong>Finance Translation</strong> and localization are so\n        important in digital finance and fintech is that they allow non-native\n        speakers to access and understand the products and solutions being\n        offered. Without translation, many users would be unable to navigate and\n        use digital finance and fintech platforms, as they would not be able to\n        understand the instructions and information provided.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Compliance with Local Regulations:</strong> Another important\n        reason why translation and localization are crucial in digital finance\n        and fintech is that they allow companies to comply with local\n        regulations. Different regions have different laws and regulations\n        regarding financial solutions, and it is essential for companies to\n        ensure that they are in compliance with these regulations.\n        <strong>Finance Translation </strong>and localization can help companies\n        ensure that they are providing the correct information and disclosures\n        to users in different regions.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improved User Experience:</strong>\n<strong>Finance Translation </strong>and localization can also help\n        improve the user experience for digital finance and fintech users. By\n        providing information and instructions in a user’s native language,\n        users are more likely to understand and trust the products and solutions\n        being offered. This can lead to increased engagement and a higher level\n        of trust in the company.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Increased Market Potential:</strong>\n<strong>Finance Translation</strong> and localization can help increase\n        the market potential for digital finance and fintech companies. By\n        making products and solutions available in multiple languages and\n        localizing them for different regions, companies can reach a wider\n        audience and expand their customer base. This can lead to increased\n        revenue and growth for the company.\n      </li>\n</ol>",

Financial products and solutions can be highly technical,\n        and it can be difficult to accurately translate the specialized language\n        used in these industries.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Constant updates and Changes:</strong> Another challenge is\n        keeping up with the constant updates and changes in the digital finance\n        and fintech industry. As new products and solutions are developed and\n        regulations change, companies must ensure that their\n        <strong>Finance Translations</strong> and localizations are up to date.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cultural Differences:</strong> Cultural differences can also\n        pose a challenge for translation and localization in digital finance and\n        fintech. Different regions may have different cultural norms and\n        expectations when it comes to financial products and solutions, and\n        companies must take these into account when localizing their products.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ensuring Quality:</strong> Ensuring the quality of translations\n        and localizations is also an ongoing challenge. It is important to\n        ensure that translations are accurate and convey the intended meaning\n        and that localizations take into account regional variations and\n        cultural differences.\n      </li>\n</ol>",

        "<p>\n      There has been a constant debate and speculation on whether India has any\n      national language. However, the answer to this is that India does not have\n      a national language.

This makes Hindi the most widely spoken language in the country,\n      followed by Bengali, Telugu, and Marathi. However, despite many efforts\n      and discussions to make Hindi the national language of the country, Hindi\n      still enjoys the status of a regional language and it is also the official\n      language of Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\n      Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh.\n    </p>",

On one hand, Hindi is the most widely spoken language\n      in India and has strong ties to Indian culture and history. On the other\n      hand, English is the primary language of education and business and is an\n      international language spoken and understood by many around the world. The\n      only possible way out of this is adopting a multi-lingual approach by\n      giving importance to the official regional languages as well as English.\n    </p>",

This can be especially important for works that are written in\n        a language that is not widely spoken or for authors who are not\n        well-known outside their own language community.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facilitating the exchange of ideas:</strong> Translation allows\n        people from different language communities to access and learn from one\n        another’s ideas and perspectives. It can facilitate the exchange of\n        knowledge and cultural understanding between people who may otherwise be\n        isolated from one another due to language barriers.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promoting cultural diversity:</strong> Translation can help to\n        preserve and promote linguistic and cultural diversity by making it\n        possible for people from different language communities to access and\n        appreciate the literature and other cultural works of other groups.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enhancing economic opportunities: </strong>Translation can help\n        to open up new markets for publishers and authors by making their works\n        available to a wider audience. This can lead to increased sales and\n        revenue, which can be especially important for small or independent\n        publishers and authors.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improving literacy rates:</strong> Translation can also play a\n        role in improving literacy rates by making books and other written works\n        available in languages that are more widely spoken in a given region.\n        This can help to promote education and lifelong learning.\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encouraging the translation of important works:</strong> By\n        publishing translated works, publishers can help to bring attention to\n        important or influential works that may not have been widely read or\n        known in the target language. This can help to ensure that these works\n        are not lost or forgotten and are available for future generations to\n        read and appreciate.\n      </li>\n</ol>",

        "<p><strong>Punctuality</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A professional, high-quality translation should always finish work on\n      time, no matter what. At the start of a project, you should discuss and\n      agree on how long it will take to complete, and everyone should know that\n      your deadlines are hard and fast. A professional <strong>publishing translation</strong> expert with much experience can tell if a project can be finished\n      in a certain amount of time. In contrast, less experienced providers often\n      make promises they cannot keep.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Languages Served </strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      One important thing to look at is how many languages they can deal with.\n      Even though they need to be good at the two languages your project needs,\n      hiring an agency with experience in other languages is a good idea. You\n      may want to enter new markets in the future, and it is always best to work\n      with a company that does business in all of the world’s major languages.\n      When you need another language in the future, you will not have to go\n      through the same process of choosing <strong>a publishing translation </strong>agency or working with two different agencies, which will be more trouble\n      for you.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Turnaround Time</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      In business, the right timing can make the difference between great\n      success and average one. Therefore, you should always look at how long the\n      agency says it will take to get back to you. Work with agencies with\n      strict deadlines and are willing to pay penalties if they miss them. This\n      shows that the agency is professional and has the resources to handle a\n      project of your size. Most agencies that do not agree to strict deadlines\n      look for freelancers after they have started a new project. This means\n      they do not have much control over the quality of the work.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Lastly, keep an eye on how much the project will cost. Some agencies will\n      give you quotes that seem too good to be accurate, but their solutions\n      will usually be just as bad. You should avoid agencies that use price as\n      their only selling point. On the other hand, the most expensive agencies\n      may also be charging you more than they should. Therefore, you should make\n      a short list of a few agencies and get quotes before deciding on the one\n      that will give you the best quality and the most for your money.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      In conclusion, picking the right <strong>publishing translation </strong>agency is a critical business decision. It can make or break your\n      business, and it can also have serious legal consequences. If you keep\n      these five things in mind, you will be able to choose the right\n      translation brand and reach your goals.

For\n      instance, transliteration is used in international news when you can\n      conveniently read in your native language. Another example of\n      transliteration is restaurant menus, where you can read dishes in\n      different languages. Transliteration is a vital tool in the banking and\n      finance industry for clients to read their bank information in their\n      native language. It ensures that clients can read or hear a word in their\n      native language despite the differences between languages.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Maintain smooth communication with native speakers</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Transliteration is beneficial when you work abroad. You may find it easier\n      to communicate with others if the words are in the Latin alphabet. Without\n      it, shopping and taking the right direction on highways and subways can\n      become difficult.\n    </p>",

Globalization has changed how companies do business\n      and how people interact with them for a long time now. However, after a\n      long time when mass chains dominated consumer markets, localization is\n      slowly gaining an edge. Local businesses are becoming more well-known and\n      appealing to local markets. This is because they offer a customized\n      experience that meets the needs of their customers.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The idea behind localization is to change your content carefully. This\n      helps fit in with the local culture and meet the standards and\n      expectations of the area.\n    </p>",

If you translate your marketing\n      content correctly, your potential customers will have a better experience\n      and be more likely to buy from you.\n    </p>",

If you do this, your company will be seen as a global business\n      that can meet the changing needs of its customers.

It\n      is one of the most important ways for businesses to reach new audiences\n      and get people to buy their products.

As AI improves, modern <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation-api/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">machine translation API</a> </strong>has several benefits that are all its own. Here are five good reasons to\n      use machine translation to give you a sense of the situation.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Machine Translation Is Faster</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the best things about <strong>machine translation API</strong> is its quick work. MT can translate quickly enough for real-time\n      business communication when set up correctly. An MT array can translate\n      hundreds of thousands of words per second with the right server setup,\n      which is often provided in the cloud. When used with one round of human\n      post-editing, MT can cut turnaround times by 35 percent or more, depending\n      on the project’s size.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Improve Terminology Consistency</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Another benefit of <strong>machine translation API </strong>is\n      that it ensures that terms are always used in the same way. This is\n      especially important for projects that are more significant because it\n      makes it easier to track the words being used. Large human projects would\n      need to be translated by more than one person simultaneously. This makes\n      it harder to keep the same tone and control the terminology than machine\n      translation.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong> Drive down The Total Cost of Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Human translation is 100 times more expensive than machine translation.\n      This is true even if the deployment is customized and secure. Even when\n      the technology is used with human post-editing, it still cuts costs by\n      15–30%. The key is to train the MT engine to almost perfectly copy your\n      voice, tone, and style.\n    </p>",

        "<p data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\">\n      We are living in a multilingual world, where the translation is crucial to\n      ensure that you pass on accurate messages from one end to another.\n      Multilingualism paves the perfect direction for businesses in the foreign\n      economy, especially in industries like the publishing media.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Media is a vast field including all types of information such as\n      promotional, advertisement, social media posts, mass media campaigns, and\n      much more.

According to the latest census, the\n      language is spoken by around 33 million people.

        "<p>\n      In this blog, we will discuss the importance of\n      <strong>English to Malayalam translation</strong> in publishing media.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Bridges language gap:</strong><br/>English to Malayalam\n      translation helps to bridge the communication gap. Expert translators have\n      a vast knowledge of the cultural nuances of the target population and,\n      hence, deliver the best output possible.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Expand your clientele:</strong><br/>The primary reason to\n      translate your business materials is to reach a more comprehensive portion\n      of the audience. There are various ways to boost traffic with\n      Malayalam-speaking regions, but the most potential way is to convey your\n      content in their native\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a>.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>Increases brand value:</strong><br/>It is almost impossible to\n      retain the brand value high because you are dealing with various phrases,\n      cultures, traditions, and native languages. Any misinterpretation or\n      misleading information could destroy the brand value, and consumers will\n      question your business authenticity.<br/>Through English to Malayalam\n      translation, all your information and data are conveyed accurately with\n      the essence of the original documents.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Enhanced visibility among domestic players:<br/></strong>A\n      significant advantage of having a translation agency alongside your\n      publishing media business is that it helps to differentiate yourself from\n      others. People prefer and trust products that are adapted to their native\n      language.

        "<p>\n<strong>Encourages collaboration:</strong><br/>Several events happen in a\n      year, bringing people from around the globe. Accurate translation is a\n      must to participate in media events. English to Malayalam translation\n      allows you to participate and collaborate with other businesses.\n      Collaborating helps you to gain the consumers of the other businesses,\n      which increases views and traffic to your website.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>OTT translation:</strong><br/>Media platforms are gaining immense\n      popularity due to the entertainment quotient it carries and the quality of\n      content. The rise of OTT platforms has changed the game in the\n      entertainment industry. It has encouraged production houses to refine the\n      quality of their content. OTT has started translating content into various\n      languages. To reach more visibility of content, the global OTT players are\n      translating the media into different regional languages. Translating\n      content into local languages increases the viewership of the content.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      OTT translation ensures that information is related to linguistic nuance\n      and aligns with the viewer’s environment. To survive in large\n      international and regional OTT platforms, one has to adapt its content\n      into regional languages to meet the local demand. OTT translation gives\n      the desired competitive edge and allows OTT players to compete on a larger\n      scale.\n    </p>",

        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">A reputed government tech institute in India, well-known for its digital-first approach to education. Their digital learning content has grown rapidly in recent years</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Challenge</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">The institute has students from rural and semi-urban regions, many of whom were more comfortable learning in their mother tongue. So the challenge was to make their existing video lessons work in multiple Indian languages without starting from scratch.<br />We discussed over 120 hours of video lectures, tutorials, explainers, and walkthroughs. Some were simple talking-head formats, but others had synced slides, on-screen elements, and interactive segments.<br />Voice-overs for all the subtitles, synced perfectly, with accurate technical vocabulary, delivered in a tight window. Plus, the final output needed to slot neatly into their LMS (Learning Management System) without breaking any tracking or completion data.</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Solution</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We ran the original English videos through our transcription engine. The tool’s trained on Indian accents for solid accuracy. Time-stamped scripts made syncing easier down the line.<br />So we used our AI-powered machine translation API models fine-tuned for Indian education content, and for the perfection of the sensitive or technical bits.<br />For voice-overs, we used a mix of synthetic voices and professional artists. We matched voices to the subject matter so the tone didn’t feel robotic or out of place.<br />We reassembled everything, syncing the voice tracks, adjusting timing, and adding multilingual subtitles. After internal QA, we packaged it all into LMS-ready formats (SCORM, xAPI, etc.) so it could be uploaded without needing developer time.</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Key Features</h3>",
        "<ul><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Custom Language Models trained on domain-specific content</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Smart voice tech that adjusted pitch and tone based on context</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Manual QA passes at critical points, especially on terminology.</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Non-intrusive integration into the client’s LMS without rework</p></li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">End-to-end encryption and secure data handling throughout</p>",
        "<h3 class=\"f-24 f-600 text-black mb-3\">Impact</h3>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We reduced the average localization time per video from nearly 3 hours to under 40 minutes.</p>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Here’s what changed:</p>",
        "<ul><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Faster delivery: Everything went live in under 9 weeks</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Cost savings: Estimated 70–75% lower cost than traditional voice-over studios</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Student response: Modules in regional languages saw up to 62% more completions compared to English-only versions</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">No tech hiccups: The team dropped the new content into the LMS with zero disruption</p></li><li><p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">Scalability: The institute expanded the project to three more departments afterwards</p></li></ul>",
        "<p class=\"f-400 text-para mb-4\">We’ve brought together speed, accuracy, and cultural nuance. If you’re trying to scale content for multiple Indian languages while keeping things fast and cost-effective, we’re here to help.</p>"

        "<p>\n      It was after working in the IT industry for almost a decade that East\n      Delhi-resident Nakul Kundra decided to take the entrepreneurial plunge by\n      establishing Devnagri—an AI-powered translation platform. With a great\n      passion for marketing and technology, this 37-year-old launched his\n      start-up with an aim to make content accessible for those who use the\n      internet in their native languages. A self-proclaimed travel buff, Kundra\n      has globe-trotted across the world (he has been to more than 30 countries\n      including France, Japan, etc.,). In this interview with The Morning\n      Standard, he gets candid about his travel experiences and the many lessons\n      he has learnt while building Devnagri.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Tell us about your start-up Devnagri.</strong><br/>I worked in\n      the IT sector for almost a decade; I was developing applications. At one\n      point, we wanted to create something like the Google Play Store—the India\n      app store where we could get all Indian language applications other than\n      others. At that point, we created a community of Android developers to\n      help us with our work. The community consisted of 10,000 developers at\n      that point, but when we started speaking to them, we realised the problem\n      was that content [on the internet] was not available in Indian languages.\n      Manual translation houses would often take over two months for a\n      10,000-word text. This is when we realised that it was not a scalable\n      solution for the B2B sector, and we started working on Devnagri.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>How do you spend your time when you’re not working?</strong><br/>The majority of my time usually goes into planning for Devnagri—how\n      to scale it, and how to take it forward. If and when I get time, I like to\n      travel and read. While the latter helps me enhance my knowledge, the\n      former allows me to unwind and clear my head so that I can think clearly.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Since your work is in the realm of language and technology, do your\n        travel experiences help you unwind?</strong><br/>I have been to over 30 countries—Belgium, Luxembourg, etc. When I\n      travel, there are multiple things I observe—the language, the people, and\n      the culture. For instance, when I went to Japan, I realised that people\n      there talk in their local language. Japan is also very advanced and is one\n      of the most productive economies in the world. If a country like such has\n      95 per cent of their population talking in their native language, then why\n      can’t India do the same. If we promote this concept of [communicating in]\n      Indian languages, especially in this time when the internet is on the\n      rise, India too can develop the same way.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Tell us the one place that’s on your travel bucket list next?</strong><br/>Now, I look forward to travelling to Switzerland because it seems\n      like the perfect place. I can go to, relax, and just be at peace for a\n      while. Such an experience will also help me be more productive later.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>You have also mentioned that you enjoy reading…</strong><br/>I\n      like to read about managerial concepts—experiences of people, new ideas,\n      and more. So, for instance, I like the books written by internet\n      entrepreneur Ankur Warikoo [he is the founder of Nearbuy, a public\n      speaker, and a YouTuber]. Warikoo talks about the practicality of business\n      and how one can take things forward.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Are there any lessons you have learnt while setting-up\n        Devnagri?</strong><br/>Yes—to be focused and confident about what you are doing. If you\n      are focused and consistent, you will achieve something for sure. I also\n      feel that in your journey to achieve something, there will be several\n      people who question you, criticise you, or even demotivate you. But, if\n      you are confident about your idea and resolute about achieving something\n      in life, people’s mindsets won’t be able to digress you from your path.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The banking sector is the core of any economy. In developed countries,\n      Indian banking is operational in English, and banks face many\n      Hindi-speaking people looking for translation solutions.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Today there are a huge number of translation agencies that provide their\n      translation solutions to the financial sector in India. Still, not all\n      companies have translated their websites from English to Hindi.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Reasons why the banking sector is choosing English to Hindi\n        translations</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>To provide services to Non-English Speaking customers</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      Sometimes banks do not offer their services to non-English speaking\n      customers, because of which the business may go down. To attract new\n      customers, banks have to think of providing information in Hindi.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>To make your website user-friendly</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Users will be more comfortable with the website by providing a translation\n      from English to Hindi. For example, a customer comes on your bank’s\n      website and does not know the English language but finds many words that\n      he doesn’t understand, so he gets irritated or bored and goes away.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      With the advancement of technology, we have seen the rise of other Indian\n      languages in the market. Most people don’t see information in Hindi, which\n      affects their decision. People from every state understand their own\n      language mostly. So, if you want to attract customers from other states,\n      you must provide them with your translation into their languages.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>To meet the needs of your customers</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Providing\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/english-to-hindi-translation/\">English to Hindi translation</a></strong>\n      solutions will help you reach a wider audience because most people can\n      understand Hindi more than English, making it easier for them to connect\n      with your business.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      For the globalization of the banking sector and to attract more people,\n      banks should provide information in the Hindi language. Banks can easily\n      provide their services to all over India through their website, which\n      should be in the Hindi language.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Legality</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      To understand the correct translation of legal documents, banks have to\n      convert them into Hindi because, in India, many people still don’t know\n      the English language. A huge number of people who can’t understand English\n      want to know about their savings bank account, such as CD rates, interest\n      rates, etc., so they can deposit their money.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The project manager usually has to spend much time on administrative tasks\n      like checking source materials for updates, creating projects, assigning\n      translators, and downloading and uploading files. This is where\n      <strong>translation API</strong> comes in handy. It’s a step toward\n      getting access to many features that will make these tasks easier.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      You might not have to do projects and all the other work that goes along\n      with them. For example, you can tell an API to send bots to your source\n      site every day to look for changes. When new content is found, it is sent\n      to all your\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a> translation\n      projects. The files are sent to linguists based on how successful they\n      have been with your company in the past. Once they are done, they are\n      reviewed and pushed live. This happens with little help from management,\n      making almost all project management processes automatic.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Here are reasons why more industries are investing in\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/translation-api-fast-way-for-content-translation-in-indian-languages/\">translation API</a></strong>\n      to make content that can be read in more than one language.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Improve Translation Efficiency</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      A free online translation tool makes it possible for anyone to translate.\n      However, the quality is usually not that good, and you do not always have\n      the option to upload your original files directly. This problem can be\n      solved by a business translation API that works with various file formats.\n      That means you will not have to copy and paste from Google Translate back\n      and forth anymore.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Boost Brand Recognition and Consistency</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Recent translation statistics on Indian markets show that 75% of consumers\n      prefer to shop on websites in their native language. In other words, the\n      number of people who might buy from you grows when your business assets\n      are easier for more native speakers to use and like. A study even found\n      that ads tailored to a specific area had a higher conversion and\n      click-through rates.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      However, brand visibility may only have a lasting effect if the message is\n      consistent, this is where translation API comes in. The same branding rule\n      applies when making content or translating content for a brand: the\n      process should be a cycle, not a straight line. Translation API makes it\n      easy to save and find old work aptly named translation memories. When it\n      finds similarities in the new document, it gives them to the translator as\n      references.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Improve Collaboration among Hybrid Teams</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Some translation APIs also work as a place for people to work together on\n      projects. You can quickly get a group together to work on different\n      projects. Due to the pandemic, remote work is a hot topic right now.\n      However, translation is a field where working from home would be useful\n      for a long time. In addition, the reason is that you would have to work\n      with partners, teams, or freelancers from other countries to create\n      content in multiple languages. With translation API, it is much easier to\n      put together a team for each project and ensure everyone is on the same\n      page.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      The translation cycle makes your business more valuable over time. Every\n      new piece you translate adds to your translation memory and gives you\n      something new to work with in the translation process. Since some\n      materials, like catalogues and guides, tend to repeat themselves, your\n      team could translate more quickly, especially if they can find 30–50% of\n      the same texts in the archives.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Every time you can reuse a translation or fix it up, it is an opportunity\n      to save time, energy, and money. In addition,\n      <strong>translation API </strong>helps with that. In other words, you\n      would be able to control the whole translation process, right down to the\n      cost, if you had a business translation API.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Having many students from other countries makes a school better and more\n      appealing to people who want to go there. <strong>Website localization</strong> is important for getting people to sign up for classes.\n      Informational and advertising content used by an educational center must\n      be translated and localized so that people can read it in their language\n      with just one click.

They need some words to look at.\n      Therefore, adding subtitles to your video will give search engines more\n      information to index. With this, you will get more organic traffic and\n      rank higher in search engines because you will use a broader range of\n      keywords. The two benefits will increase the number of people who watch\n      your media.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      There has been a significant rise in <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/elearning-translation/\">e-learning translation</a> </strong>platforms and solutions in the last few years. Before the pandemic, the\n      switch from in-person classroom learning to online learning was already\n      well underway. Because of this, many companies have realized how important\n      eLearning translation is and how many benefits it has.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      When you share online learning content with the people you want to learn\n      it, they are more likely to remember it if they can understand and relate\n      to it. This can mean hiring <strong>eLearning translation</strong> agency to adapt the content to a new language. However, it can also\n      include localizing eLearning so your students can access helpful material.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Why It Is a Good Idea to Use E-Learning Translation Solutions?</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      Since COVID-19 started, we have all had to learn to use online services\n      amid the chaos. E-learning has become more popular and is valuable and\n      helpful for everyone involved whether you’re a businessperson who wants to\n      reach more people inside and outside your office or a teacher or student\n      in a language course, e-learning and language courses have shown to be\n      just as good as those in person, with a few extra benefits.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Effective for Learners</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>eLearning translation ensures</strong> that many learners can\n      use the content and all learning materials. Not only that, but your\n      students are more likely to understand the subject if you address the\n      cultural differences of the people you are trying to reach. Because of\n      this, eLearning translation works well.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Here are a few more ways that eLearning translation and localization can\n      change the way online learning is done.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Offer Time Flexibility</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      No one should be surprised that it is much easier to plan your time when\n      you do not have to deal with a long commute. With <strong>e-Learning translation </strong>solutions, you can work around your schedule. You do not have to find\n      time to meet with a professional translator, which can make your schedule\n      even more complicated. It also makes language classes easier to get into.\n      With e-Learning translation, you can access your class on time and in your\n      language. \n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>There is no such thing as too far with e-learning translation</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      When discussing access and travel, many people give up learning a\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a> or\n      translating because there is not anyone nearby to help. For example,\n      finding people who speak Swahili or Korean outside a big city can be hard.\n      With <strong>e-Learning translation</strong> assistance, you can\n      not only find a class or a translator worldwide, but your location is no\n      longer a barrier. \n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      This gives you many options that let you think about your specific\n      language level, focus, commitment, and all the other factors that can fit\n      your learning needs. So, if your organization uses e-learning translation\n      solutions, it will help in expanding its global reach.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Helps You Attract Global Talent</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      To get people from all over the world to work for you, you need to show\n      them that you are a global company that cares about your culture and who\n      you are as a person. You can do more to ensure your employees feel seen\n      and heard if you talk to them in their language. Therefore, localizing\n      your eLearning can be crucial to ensuring your company thrives worldwide.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      From an academic and a business perspective, e-learning gives you a lot of\n      ways to grow your business and your education. Let\n      <strong>e-learning translation</strong> for corporate language\n      programs help you better connect with the world around you. Certified\n      professional translators can help you get the word out about your business\n      or organization to people who speak different languages, which is\n      essential in today’s globalized and connected world.\n    </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n      Transliteration helps us to pronounce words in another language whereas\n      translation gives us the meaning of words. Transliteration changes the\n      words from one language or alphabet into another corresponding, with\n      similar-sounding letters with different characters.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      For example, the word for the festival of lights holiday in Hebrew is\n      חנוכה. When we transliterate the word into English it becomes Chanukah or\n      Hanukkah. In Hindi, the transliteration is chaanooka or hanuka.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Transliteration can also be done in more than one way. Many languages,\n      such as Nepali and Hindi use a Devanagari, Bulgarian and Russian, use the\n      Cyrillic alphabet, while the Kanji script is used by\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese\">Japanese</a>.\n      Transliteration changes these words into Latin alphabets but does not\n      translate their meanings.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Latin alphabets are used in some of the most used languages around the\n      world, including Spanish,\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\">English</a>, Hindi,\n      French, and German.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      If the words ‘Good Evening’ aren’t transliterated to Simplified Hindi\n      (namaste) using Latin alphabets, Hindi letters (नमस्ते) can be challenging\n      for any person but a Hindi speaker to understand. Those of us who like\n      exploring Hindi and other indigenous languages of India-speaking countries\n      should be grateful that transliteration exists!\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Examples of transliteration</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      If you go to an Indian restaurant in London, you often notice that their\n      menu isn’t written in English, but you can roughly guess the meaning. For\n      example, shoraba or maans. If “maans” was written in Hindi characters\n      (मांस) you would have no idea what those characters meant unless you were\n      a Hindi speaker. Hindi restaurants help their customers by providing a\n      transliteration of the Simplified Hindi script into Latin letters to help\n      you understand their menu.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>Using transliteration and translation in the same document:</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Translation formatting:</strong> Which comes first, the\n      translation or the transliteration? You might determine that the English\n      translation appears after the first instance of the transliteration, or\n      vice versa. Determine whether the translation is written into the sentence\n      (or in parentheses).\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Translation frequency:</strong> Do you want your text to read like\n      an English-only text? Use transliterations sparingly and stick primarily\n      to the translation. Do you want readers to feel like they’re reading\n      bilingually and getting a feel for the non-English words? Use\n      transliterations more freely. Once you choose an approach, implement it\n      consistently. For example, you may decide that a transliteration is\n      translated the first time it appears in an article, but not in subsequent\n      appearances of the word within that same article.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>How to use transliteration:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      If you’re working with materials that include transliterations, you may\n      discover that attempts to limit mayhem of grammar, spelling, and\n      formatting can thwart the most devoted of wordsmiths. If you’re\n      transliterating from a language that does not use the Latin alphabet, you\n      may find that transliteration rules can’t be universally applied; one\n      enthusiastically aims for consistency but finds it is the hobgoblin of\n      literary minds.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Also Read:\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/is-website-translation-important-for-the-fintech-companies-in-india\">Is Website Translation Important For The Fintech Companies In\n          India</a>?</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Below are some key issues and considerations when making your\n        transliteration writing and formatting decisions:</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Character formatting:</strong> It may be helpful to italicize\n      transliterated words. While it’s cleanest to keep the character format\n      simple, those of us who dislike italics may opt to use them anyway once we\n      discover a worse alternative: the terror of perpetual quotation marks.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Capitalization:</strong> Transliterated words need a consistent\n      capitalization protocol. You can either keep all transliterations\n      capitalized or in lower case, the first letter of each word. Squash the\n      urge to leave some transliterations in lower case and others in upper\n      case.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Letter mapping:</strong> If you’re dealing with a language in\n      which multiple letters make the same sound, you will need to decide how to\n      transliterate each of the letters into English. For example, in Hebrew,\n      you might decide to mark the letter het and the khaf as kh, which makes\n      the same guttural sound, as h.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Titles:</strong> Do you want transliterations in titles? If your\n      transliterations come with a particular format, such as parentheses,\n      italics, or quotation marks, they may be too unwieldy. You may decide to\n      use English-only titles.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Popularized Spellings:</strong> Once you adopt a letter mapping\n      approach and apply it consistently, you run into a problem, coping with\n      accepted spellings. For example, if you’re transliterating names of\n      popular concepts, foods, cities, or common spellings exist and the\n      question becomes whether to “insist” on the consistency of common usage or\n      bow to house style. In many cases, you simply cannot cross the spelling\n      that is used, for example, in a city’s literature.\n    </p>",

If you want\n      subtitles, the script, transcript, or dialogue is translated into another\n      language, and the words are put on top of the video or movie. Most of the\n      time, the subtitle translation are shown at the bottom of the screen.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Dubbing</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Dubbing is a step that is done after the video or film has been made.\n      Voice-over artists are used to replacing the original actors’ voices with\n      dialogues. Voice-over actors who speak a different language are used for\n      this. The new sound is mixed with the old sound to finish the soundtrack.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The original voices of the actors can be heard in videos with subtitles.\n      Professional subtitle translation teams make sure that the subtitles are\n      translated correctly. With this method, people who are hard of hearing or\n      deaf or have trouble understanding accents or spoken dialogue can still\n      enjoy the video content because it is also available in written form.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Dubbing: Benefits</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      When a video is dubbed, the audience can hear the sound in their language,\n      which helps them enjoy the video or film more. However, it takes time to\n      dub the video. It takes a long time and is complicated to do. At the same\n      time, dubbing costs more, especially for a full-length film, because it\n      requires more work after the film is made.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Most of the actors from the original video are not used when the video is\n      dubbed. Instead, the producers have to hire a group of voice-over artists\n      who speak the language they are making the video in. The person making the\n      video has to hire a voice actor for each character most of the time.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Deciding Which Method to Use on Video Projects</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Both dubbing and subtitling have their pros and cons. When it comes to\n      video projects, the choice depends on several things. Some well-known\n      people who appear in a video may ask the production company to dub the\n      audio to protect their reputations as good speakers. This is because they\n      want people to be able to match their voices to their body language or\n      face.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      When choosing between the two ways, age is a factor. Dubbing is the best\n      way to make educational and informational videos for young children.\n      People who have trouble hearing, trying to learn a foreign language, and\n      older children can all use subtitles.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The idea and benefits of\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation/\">machine translation</a></strong>\n      have also come a long way. It has grown into something that has completely\n      changed the translation industry. Almost all of the big translation\n      companies in the world use at least some tools when working on texts, and\n      it is easy to see why given how much has changed in recent years. Here are\n      the main reasons why machine translation can be helpful in modern\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology\">technology</a>.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Reduced Costs and Faster Turnaround</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      With high throughput and the ability to choose from existing language\n      pairs, covering dozens of combinations of<strong>\n        machine translation</strong> can cut costs and delivery time for translations even when human\n      translators are still editing the work after it has been translated. MT\n      does most of the hard work at the beginning by giving simple but valuable\n      translations. The human translator then changes these basic versions to\n      make them more like the original content and make sure they are localized\n      correctly for each region.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Also Read:\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/understanding-subtitle-translation-and-how-it-plays-a-major-role-in-businesses\">Understanding Subtitle Translation and How it Plays a Major Role in\n          Businesses</a></strong>\n</p>",
        "<p><strong>Automated integration into translation workflows</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Many translation management systems use one or more types of machine\n      translation (MT) as part of their workflow. As part of the human\n      translator content package, they have settings that let you run a\n      translation automatically and send it off. Given that the <strong>machine translation</strong> step is cheap and does not take long, there is no reason not to\n      include machine-translated content in workflow automation, especially for\n      internal documentation and communication rather than customer-facing and\n      brand-oriented.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Speedy Results</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      Speed is another good thing about using translation technology. Most of\n      the time, it will be faster to use an app or translation software to\n      translate simple words or phrases than to use a human translator or\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter\">interpreter</a>. If\n      you care about speed, machine-based translation is a good choice.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Dealing with Data</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      If you have, many data to deal with, machine-based or digitally based\n      translation services may be your best bet. A computer or even a smartphone\n      than by a person can handle large amounts of data much faster. Many types\n      of translation software can also remember critical phrases or words used\n      often in what you are translating. This makes the process go even faster.\n      When put together with designs that make it easy to use, it can speed up\n      the whole process.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Enhanced Timeline</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      One of the best things about <strong>machine translation</strong> is how fast it works. Human translation takes a longer than machine\n      translation. The average human translator can translate about 2,000 words\n      a day, and even though a project can be given to more than one translator\n      to increase output, this is still not as fast as machine translation.\n      Every minute, machine translation can come up with thousands of new words.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Also Read:\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/essential-features-you-must-know-about-transliteration-api\">Essential Features You Must Know About Transliteration API</a></strong>\n</p>",
        "<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Machine translation</strong> lets systems learn essential\n      words and phrases used in a particular industry. This means that the text\n      as a whole will be more consistent. When humans translate a text, their\n      translations may change slightly depending on several factors, but a\n      machine’s translation will not.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Is this a good thing in terms of the text being consistent? If it were\n      going to be interpreted by a person, then surely another person would know\n      how to word each sentence so that it is easy to understand. It all comes\n      down to the age-old question: Is translation and art or a math problem? If\n      it is a math problem, the computer will take over and do a good job.\n      However, if <strong>machine translation </strong>stays an art\n      form, texts will always need human translators to be translated correctly.\n    </p>",

Furthermore, it\n      requires a skill that is not valued by usual computer translation.\n      Accuracy is not the only point of measurement but rather immersing\n      yourself in another\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture\">culture</a> and proposing\n      words that entirely speak to the viewer.\n    </p>",

The translator usually sticks to the original story, but\n      sometimes the translator creates dialogue to convey the same message in a\n      better way.\n    </p>",

This creates difficult decisions. They have to decide which parts\n      of the dialogue are important and which parts can be skipped.

        "<p>\n      If you are looking for a translation job, humans should do some, but\n      machines or a mix of machines and humans (MT) should do many more. As AI\n      gets better, modern MT has its own set of advantages. To give you some\n      context, here are five reasons you should use\n      <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation/\">machine translation</a></strong>.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Cheaper Than Human Translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      When the technology is used with human post-editing, it still saves 15% to\n      30% on the project’s total cost. The key is to teach the MT engine almost\n      to match your voice, tone, and style. For example, putting raw MT output\n      in a secure and trained environment costs less than a cent per word,\n      including training and support.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      As a result, a well-trained system that can translate commercial business\n      data for S&amp;P, sent to a translator for proofreading, takes a long time\n      to train and perfect. However, it still reduces the total cost of\n      translating by more than 30 percent.\n    </p>",

        "<p><strong>Great for Sifting Through Large Amounts Of Data</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      There are times when <strong>machine translation</strong> can be\n      beneficial, like when you have lots of text that needs to be translated\n      quickly, like in real-time chats or significant legal cases. In a\n      cross-border litigation case, millions of words must be produced soon.\n      This is a job that humans would not be able to do. If you have a lot of\n      documents in a different\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a>, machine\n      translation can help you quickly look through them. You can then find\n      important words and remember them for later.\n    </p>",
        "<p><strong>Faster</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n      They can be very fast, which is one of their main benefits.\n      <strong>Machine translation</strong> can be fast enough for real-time\n      communication in the workplace when it’s set up correctly. An MT array can\n      translate hundreds of thousands of words per second with the proper server\n      setup. This is often done in the cloud, where the servers are. When used\n      with one round of human post-editing, MT speeds up turnaround times by\n      about 35% or more, depending on the size of the project.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>People who use machine translation tools can help cut down on how much\n        it costs to translate.</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Creates An Ability To Balance Cost, Quality, And Time</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      People can change the cost, quality, and time of their language solutions\n      to have never been possible before with language solutions. When MT is\n      used in a holistic enterprise solution, it opens up the ability to change\n      the things in ways that have never been possible before with language\n      solutions. Moreover, when it comes to language technology, machine\n      translation can be lucrative. The custom solutions for a wide range of\n      content takes care of all the translation intricacies right from\n      translation to post editing.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Machine translation</strong> experts have the capability and\n      specialization in translation tools. They use the right combination of\n      technology and expertise to achieve precision in the job. The\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI\">AI</a>-powered machine\n      translation not only speeds up language solutions process, but also\n      enhances the quality of the translation.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Provides A Starting Point Translation For Human Production</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n      As mentioned above, MT is used by more than half of all translation\n      platforms at this point. If an MT engine is well-trained, it can be a\n      better place to start for a professional in a particular field of work. A\n      single pass through the <strong>machine translation </strong>output is\n      called post-editing, which is called that because it is done in one go. It\n      is a lot faster and cheaper translation methods as compared to traditional\n      translation processes.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Machine Translation Engine can optimally translate the content without\n      compromising its quality or output. It is one of the best and most\n      affordable methods to professionally translate a content. However, only\n      machine translation may not suffice the exact requirement of the client.\n      And hence, there should be a mix of human skills and machine translation\n      to achieve superior exactness.\n    </p>",

They are useful for\n      those who want to localize the application but do not know where to start.\n      Over the years, many translators have learned a lot through trial and\n      error and managed to collect the best\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><strong>app localization</strong></a>\n      practices, life hacks, and useful tips that you may need! So, here are\n      them\n    </p>",
        "<h2><strong>Tip 1: Assess the potential</strong></h2>",
        "<p>\n      Start with the most important thing, understand which languages need\n      translation and whether it is justified at all. Just because a certain\n      language is the most popular in the world does not mean that it is\n      entirely suitable for your product and for your audience. Study the market\n      up and down and only then get down to business.

        "<p data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\">\n      As a rule, any well-localized app product should be perceived by end-users\n      as if it was originally created in their own language. When it comes to\n      localizing marketing banners within a product, whether it’s New Year’s\n      discounts or Black Friday sales, always take into account the cultural\n      characteristics of the country in which this campaign will be launched.\n      And here, we are not talking about a banal translation of strings from\n      English into a foreign language, but about\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(disambiguation)\">adapting</a>\n      the entire program and how local users perceive it.\n    </p>",

That is why one line of English text can be equated to two or\n      even three lines of Indian.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Therefore, be prepared for the fact that for the sake of good translation,\n      you may need to make changes to the design and code.

        "<p>\n      Translation without context is called “raw.” Often it is far from reality\n      and practically not applicable in practice. Context is necessary to avoid\n      ambiguity and embarrassment when working with a translated program. And\n      the more, the better.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Translating an app</strong> consisting of several thousand lines\n      is not an easy task. And to make it easier for your team, you must\n      mentally anticipate where problems with understanding the meaning may\n      arise and prevent them.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      [:en]The history of subtitles dates back to the development of sound\n      cinema. Many industry representatives reacted negatively to the first\n      dubbed films’ appearance because “talking” films were understood only by\n      people who knew the language, in contrast to the universal silent film,\n      whose audience was not limited by\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier\">language barriers</a>.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      According to the most pragmatic sceptics, this innovation threatened to\n      sharply reduce the export of films to other countries and, as a result, a\n      significant reduction in income. However, technological progress took\n      over, and films began to gain voices.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Until the end of the 20th\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century\">century</a>, the process\n      of subtitling was quite painstaking and time-consuming.

So,\n      <strong>subtitle translation</strong> is of utmost importance to make the\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience\">audiences</a> understand.\n    </p>",

Each subtitle should be a separate sentence or a more or less\n      complete thought.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Per the specifics of human perception, subtitles should be quite compact\n      (no more than two lines) and concise (up to 30-35 printed characters per\n      line); the duration of their placement on the screen can take from 1 to 7\n      seconds. The pause between subtitles should be at least four frames. All\n      this is necessary so that a person can read the text, comprehend what he\n      has read and switch his attention from one subtitle to another.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      To get a high-quality <strong>subtitle translation</strong> in the\n      shortest possible time and at no additional cost, you should provide the\n      translator with the actual video itself and a subtitle file that contains\n      text in the source language, divided into small segments with timestamps\n      (time codes).\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      The customer can create a subtitle file on his own or entrust this work to\n      a specialist.

The client should provide information about the style of\n      presentation, the target audience for which the video is intended, and the\n      preferred translation of terms, if necessary.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      Translating subtitles is a complex process. Many technical, grammatical,\n      linguistic, and stylistic nuances cannot be neglected. Subtitles are a\n      means of communication with a foreign language audience, and it is\n      imperative that they are understandable, reliable, and perceived\n      adequately.

        "<p>\n      Some meetings, such as those involving world leaders, require translators.\n      In any event that needs such a service, the translator will access what is\n      said and needs to be translated. Generally, the speaker has a microphone,\n      and the receiver has headphones.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      The process begins when the speaker speaks in a language not commonly\n      known among the people of interest. The interpreter will then translate\n      the speech.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      The translation process is much more than exchanging words from one\n      language to another; it involves the exercise of experience and in-depth\n      knowledge of the tradition and culture of the working language.

        "<p>\n      The starting point is that a simple translation is not enough for a\n      document to have value in a country other than the one it was issued. To\n      have legal value, a document must go through a more or less long process\n      of stamps and authentications based on the number of offices that must\n      view it.\n    </p>",

        "<p>\n      [:en]Transliteration is translating a dialect from one written form to the\n      next. Though it may seem equivalent to translating, the two procedures are\n      fundamentally distinct and serve very different purposes.\n    </p>",
        "<h2><strong>What exactly is transliteration?</strong></h2>",
        "<p>\n      Transliteration is used whenever a particular phrase needs to be expressed\n      in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect\">dialect</a> with a\n      distinct writing scheme. Consider writing phrases from Russian or even\n      Japanese (which are using Cyrillic and Kanji, correspondingly) with Latin\n      letters.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Remember that <strong>transliteration api</strong> only creates a new\n      framework for the text, not a new dialect. (That is, transliteration\n      doesn’t really convert a Russian word into an English one; rather, it\n      substitutes Latin characters for Cyrillic characters.)\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      For instance, when you’re at a Chinese eatery, the menu may contain\n      Chinese symbols that you do not even understand. When such characters are\n      translated literally, they use Latin letters to match the sound of the\n      Chinese phrase. You will not comprehend the transliterated phrase if you\n      cannot read or talk Chinese. You won’t be likely to understand that the\n      Chinese phrase on the menu is translated. Would you be capable of\n      understanding it if it is translated into\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\">English</a>?\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      One thing to keep in mind about<strong> transliteration api</strong>:\n      formal nouns are frequently spelled differently, whereas many terms have\n      standardized spelling once transliterated.

        "<p>\n      [:en]New Delhi [India], February 12 (ANI/NewsVoir): Shark Tank is the new\n      craze of Indian reality TV for all the right reasons.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Talented individuals and multiple start-up brands brought exciting\n      concepts here. One of those is Devnagri, India’s very own language\n      translation engine.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      On Shark Tank India, Devnagri presented their\n      <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation.php\"><strong>Machine translation</strong> <strong>engine</strong></a>\n      that translates instantly with 85% + contextual results. Devnagri also\n      introduced Pratibimb, India’s 1st image to language app. They even invited\n      Peyush Bansal, one of the sharks and Co-founder, CEO, Lenskart, to use the\n      app and see the content in the language of his choice. The sharks\n      complimented their vision of making content accessible to all, and they\n      even got the funding. Devnagri, through AI-powered human intelligence,\n      translates up to 1 million words a day.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      A brainchild of <strong>Nakul Kundra</strong> and\n      <strong>Himanshu Sharma</strong>,<strong> Devnagri</strong> was founded\n      with a vision to make the content accessible to all and overcome the\n      linguistic barriers by creating stronger connections with the one\n      billion-plus Indians by conversing with them in their language.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      98% of Indian internet users use the internet in an\n      <strong>Indian language</strong>, either exclusively or with English, says\n      a recent Google study. 45% of local language users prefer accessing\n      content only in regional languages. 63% of local language users would like\n      to read exclusively in regional languages. This indicates the prospects\n      and potential of vernacular content in the Indian context.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Devnagri’s platform combines AI and human-powered translation with Machine\n      Learning. They are powered by Kutumbh, a community of 5000 + native\n      language speakers and translators that enable 5x faster, cost-effective,\n      and more accurate translations. The company envisions placing Indian\n      languages on a pedestal.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Speaking on the need for a seamless translation service, Himanshu Sharma,\n      Co-founder, Devnagri, says, “With more than 1200 dialects and 22 regional\n      languages, India has a vast language translation market. With Devnagri, we\n      want to help brands and individuals reach a wider audience.”\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      They have already helped some well-known e-Commerce, BFSI, and ed-tech\n      companies to communicate with their audiences in regional languages.\n      Devnagri also raised $600,000 from Venture Catalyst, Inflection Point\n      Ventures, and other co-investors.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Nakul Kundra, Co-founder, Devnagri, stated, “There is a strong need for\n      content in Indian languages to be available over the internet so that\n      people across geographies can be reached and spoken to. We intend to scale\n      our operations to tap B2B customers and enable them to create more local\n      content to reach end-users from Tier II and Tier III cities.”\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Today when India is moving towards localization, Devnagri, undoubtedly has\n      a vast scope to expand into the BFSI, Ed-Tech, OTT, e-Commerce, and many\n      more industries and help them reach their target audiences. More\n      importantly, they can help the people of India to be more connected,\n      making India truly, Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat Link.\n    </p>",
        "<p>\n      Devnagri uses <strong>machine translation technology</strong> with AI and\n      human intelligence to help brands and individuals translate content into\n      various Indian languages and build deeper connections with their\n      audiences. Their mission is to make content and information accessible to\n      Indian citizens from different parts of the country.\n    </p>",

        "<p>[:en]</p>",
        "<p class=\"Normal\">\n        By October 2021, India had almost 799 million internet users. The story\n        within this story is the projected growth of\n        <a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/indic\">Indic</a>\n        language users to reach 536 million, clocking a CAGR of 18%. This is not\n        only led by penetration of the internet in rural India, Indic language\n        users are almost 50% of the total active internet base in Urban India as\n        well.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n          This trend is expected to get more pronounced in the coming years,\n          based on the increasing availability of budget-friendly smartphones,\n          cheap mobile data and growing consumerism in rural areas. As far as\n          the internet goes, India is morphing into Bharat with Indic language\n          users accounting for close to 75% of Indian netizens.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          There are several reasons for brands to focus on these trends: 70%\n          find local language\n          <a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/digital\">digital</a>\n          content to be more reliable and 88% of\n          <a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/indian+language\">Indian language</a>\n          users are more likely to respond to a digital advertisement in their\n          language as compared to English. Roughly 90% of video consumption\n          happens in local languages.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          It’s clear, then, that local languages are a key driver of brands’\n          relevance. Given India’s size and diversity, targeting the\n          local-language-speaking majority will deepen connections and enable\n          brands to roll out campaigns at scale. That’s why, in\n          <a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/marketing\">marketing</a>\n          terms, the country is usually better approached as a region with\n          several languages and unparallelled diversity rather than one country\n          as a whole.\n        </p>",
        "<h2 class=\"Normal\">\n<strong>The rise of the language-first customer</strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p class=\"Normal\">\n        So, as more of us go online to buy what we need, get entertained and\n        maintain social connections, the use of local languages is being\n        amplified. Also, rising disposable incomes and access to technology\n        across India have stripped away the notion that the ability to speak\n        English is an indicator of wealth.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n          This is a signal for marketers to start diversifying their messages to\n          include regional languages; without that, it’ll be tough to achieve\n          reach and engagement.\n        </p>",
        "<p>Here are some trends we are witnessing:</p>",
        "<p>\n          · A focus on localised content on the back of localisation of products\n          and services\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          · Users are getting more active, leading to a rise of user-generated\n          content among Indian language users\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          · Voice is becoming the key to creation and consumption of regional\n          content. It’s no accident that major digital platforms have either\n          enabled or are looking to enable voice search for\n          <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\">Indian languages</a>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n          · Brands communicating in local languages tend to achieve greater\n          audience trust\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          · When brands localise content, customers believe in their commitment\n          towards them. This is vital for business success. It’s difficult to\n          create genuine connections if brands aren’t speaking their audience’s\n          language\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          · Brands are understanding that local language commitment goes beyond\n          Hindi, which has a 500-million-strong user base. Other Indian\n          languages boast of strong user bases too; consider Bengali (over 97\n          million speakers), Marathi (over 83 million speakers), Telugu (over 81\n          million speakers), Tamil (over 69 million speakers) and Gujarati (over\n          55 million speakers), among others.\n        </p>",
        "<h2></h2>",
        "<h2 class=\"Normal\"><strong>The new-age marketing strategy</strong></h2>",
        "<p class=\"Normal\">\n        Given the opportunity, here’s what brands should focus on while creating\n        a language-first marketing strategy.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>· A multilingual platform:</strong> Localised platforms\n          generate greater traction and have a wider reach. A platform that can\n          be accessed and understood by more people will attract local language\n          users. Advertisers must choose a platform that aligns with the user’s\n          consumption journey helps brands engage users better.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>· Regional insights to personalise\n            <a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/communication\">communication</a>:</strong>\n          Brands must invest in understanding who they’re speaking to, what\n          matters to them and how to articulate their value proposition.\n          Capturing such insights will help brands build relevant messaging\n          around its offerings.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>· Conversations, not monologues:</strong> Don’t just talk;\n          listen. Digital marketing allows advertisers to speak to customers as\n          well as to listen to them. The latter is, arguably, more important for\n          campaign and business success. Many local communities have formed and\n          are growing on social platforms, which makes it even more critical for\n          brands to reach out to these users where they are.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>· Go beyond transliteration and translation:</strong> If the\n          language marketing strategy is simply translating or transliterating\n          campaigns, it’s not going to work for brands. Advertisers have to\n          reach beyond that to create campaigns that include local nuance and\n          relevance in order to be impactful. Create an online experience in\n          users’ native languages.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          It’s no wonder that leading content platforms have listed Indian\n          languages at the top of their priority list. Global-first digital\n          companies, too, are mirroring an Indic languages-first strategy now.\n          Investors are seeing the benefit of the local-languages-first approach\n          too. They are actively seeking social media and content apps that\n          share their philosophy and want to tap into this vast market.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          Now that the importance and urgency of the Indian-language strategy\n          have been established, what does success look like? Metrics are a\n          critical cog in the marketing wheel. Customer engagement is among the\n          metric mainstays, serving as a barometer of how engaged audiences are\n          with the brand’s offerings as well as marketing assets like websites,\n          blogs, support pages and discussion forums. While there is no single\n          accepted measure of success, the following serve well in the context\n          of localisation:\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/brand+awareness\">Brand awareness</a>:</strong>\n          Brand awareness is an excellent indicator of brand success. While\n          Brand Lift studies can help advertisers understand the impact of their\n          campaigns, on-target reach or OTRs serve as an important base metric\n          for potential success. In addition, to reach, advertisers should also\n          focus on viewability, since it helps gauge the real potential impact.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Engagement: </strong>Click-through and view-through rates\n          continue to be important metrics for measuring resonance with the\n          target audience. A second level metric that brands are increasingly\n          monitoring is the potential virality or incremental reach through\n          shares. Social media platforms that provide active avenues for content\n          sharing will become even more critical in brands’ media strategy\n        </p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p class=\"Normal\">\n<strong>Conversion:</strong> With lower-funnel metrics such as\n        click-to-visit or app installs, brands can measure how their campaigns\n        are performing on business KPIs.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n          New-age social apps tend to offer brands complete measurability and\n          exposure to a much wider language-first audience. In fact, companies\n          that focus solely on English content in India are missing out. The\n          entertainment industry has already identified this as a big\n          opportunity. According to a FICCI-PwC report, the share of regional\n          language consumption on OTT platforms will cross 50% of total time\n          spent by 2025 from the 30% share it held in 2019. That’s why even\n          large OTT platforms are investing millions in regional content.\n        </p>",
        "<p>\n          Brands incorporating local languages into their marketing strategy are\n          likely to benefit through greater audience engagement, wider sales and\n          overall brand affinity.\n        </p>",

The nation\n        has more than 21 languages that civilians most use. Due to this, a\n        language like English is not used in most cases.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The problem that the nation is facing in terms of delivering services\n        and products is the language barrier. For example, videos for your\n        company or services may be useless because they may not get what you\n        want to communicate to them if you use other\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">languages</a>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Therefore, to penetrate the Indian market, you need to translate your\n        website to the videos you use for marketing or services and product\n        description. You will deliver or communicate with the Indians through\n        their local languages through <strong>video translation</strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Here is the reason why video translation in Indian languages is\n          needed –</strong>\n</p>",
        "<h3><strong>Reaching Native Speakers</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Since many civilians use their native language to communicate,\n        translating the videos to the Indian languages will reach more\n        audiences. In India, a small percentage speak a popular language like\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\">English</a>; however,\n        the bigger percentage uses local languages. It means you will need to\n        focus on their languages, and through\n        <strong>video translation</strong>, you can reach more audiences.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        With <strong>video translation</strong> in India, even when you\n        establish your business as a video translation provider, you will have a\n        vast opportunity because the services are required for learning\n        purposes, business setup, advertisement, and many other reasons.\n      </p>",

        "<h3>Ensure Accessibility</h3>",
        "<p>\n        Most videos for entertainment, education, business, and other purposes\n        are produced using English. However, you must translate them to reach\n        the Indian market with these videos. Suppose you provide the services\n        for\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations.php\"><strong>video translation</strong></a>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        In that case, India is your niche because most of the videos available\n        must be translated to India’s native languages to reach them and\n        understand what is going on through visuals and the language used in the\n        videos.\n      </p>",
        "<h3>Source of engagement</h3>",
        "<p>\n        If you watch a video translated to the language you most understand, you\n        will have better engagement. Most people tend to watch only videos with\n        the language they know.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        For example, views are always fewer if a video is in another language or\n        is not translated well. But for the videos in a native language or\n        translated well, the viewer will be more, and the number of shares or\n        likes will be higher because the engagement rate is higher.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Since most businesses, the education sector, and other fields dwell on\n        how to engage with their audience, then\n        <strong>video translation</strong> in Indian languages is the need of\n        time. It is expected that 9 out of the 10 in the next 5 years will be\n        Indian language users on\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\">Internet</a> in India\n      </p>",
        "<h3>Making the civilians in India feel valued</h3>",
        "<p>\n        Remember, in many nations, English comes as the second language for the\n        majority of the people. If someone shares a video in a language you do\n        not understand; you may conclude that this is not meant for a specific\n        category of people.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        However, through the <strong>video translation</strong>, you can share\n        the message in your video through a large group of people who use\n        different languages. However, everyone will feel like the potential\n        viewer targeted by the producer of the video.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Remember, many people associate with brands that make them feel valued.\n        Therefore, you need <strong>video translation</strong> services to\n        identify yourself with the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\">Indian</a> potential\n        viewers.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Remember that if video marketing is one of your strategies in India, you\n        will have to invest in <strong>video translation</strong> to maximize\n        the target audience you want to reach.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        If you create videos or already have them, you have to make sure that\n        they are translated to the Indian language to succeed in India.\n        <strong>Video translation</strong> is a current need for you to\n        penetrate the Indian market.[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>Machine translation</strong> is continually changing and\n        improving, but several undeniable advantages have surfaced as the\n        software improves in accuracy and reliability. While MT is not suitable\n        for every translation circumstance and has yet to replace human\n        translation, it speeds up translation and reduces translation expenses,\n        provides faster translation\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        MT can translate papers in about half the time it takes a person, making\n        it suitable for jobs that need a speedy response. Machine translation is\n        a common alternative to human linguists when time is limited, and simply\n        an approximation or summary translation is required.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Machine translation</strong> is handy when scanning a text to\n        locate specific passages, sections, or pages to translate—having someone\n        translate the whole manuscript when you need a few portions here is\n        time-consuming and wasteful. MT may go straight to the components you\n        need.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        However, you nearly always sacrifice significant quality in exchange for\n        quicker speeds and turnaround times.

A\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native\">native</a> speaker would\n        find the translated text rough and, most likely, inconvenient to read if\n        no post-editing was done.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Most notably, MT is less costly since a computer rather than a person\n        performs it. Without the requirement for labour, the cost of every human\n        work that is finally replaced by a machine drops drastically.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The more you put into translation engines and train them, the more\n        accurate the translations they create will be. Your expenses will\n        decrease over time as better and higher-quality translations are\n        produced, and human editing becomes less necessary. As a result, machine\n        translation may be the best long-term investment for your company’s\n        future translation requirements. Also, It must be noted that as per a\n        survey 9 out of 10 internet users in India will be\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_languages\">Indian Language</a>\n        users.\n      </p>",

Machine translation is less expensive\n        and more efficient; however, human translation is more accurate and\n        professional. Both arguments have validity.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Until machine translation evolves beyond its current capabilities, the\n        ideal option for most businesses is a hybrid of machine and human\n        translation.

Even a minor mis-translation may affect the whole meaning,\n        rendering it invalid.\n      </p>",

Consequently,\n        crucial ideas may be overlooked or misrepresented throughout the\n        translation process.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Furthermore, each section of the legal profession uses its own set of\n        words, necessitating even greater specialization on the translator’s\n        part. Patent applications, for example, are pretty thorough and must\n        meet the standards of all of the nations concerned.

        "<p>\n        The final paperwork will be culturally acceptable if the translation\n        company uses native speakers. Furthermore, since many words have many\n        meanings, the translator must evaluate the proper usage of a word or\n        phrase and choose the one that best conveys the message.\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native\">Native</a> speakers would\n        also be aware of the optimal wording for legal documents.\n      </p>",

Here, you will store the translated content without the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">HTML</a> markup. Once the\n        user requests translated data, the data will be available within your\n        server.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        When users request the content in a given language most of the time, you\n        are charged by your Translation API provider. To reduce the cost, you\n        will need to have a database that will save the translated content to\n        your database. So the second time a user from the same region translates\n        the website, make your website query your website to check the content\n        in the database. If the content is already there, it should load it, and\n        if it is not there,it makes use of the API. This procedure will reduce\n        the money you pay to your API provider.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>3. Using translation plugins</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        If you are using content management systems like WordPress,\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal\">Drupal</a>, Joomla and\n        many others customizing the way Translation API plugins behave will be a\n        significant advantage. You can manipulate the plugins and allow them to\n        translate the website into all the available languages and store the\n        page in your content management system. Once one tries to translate the\n        website, it will just look for a page with that requested language and\n        display it.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>4. Avoid using API keys</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Rather than using API keys, use a service account for the Translation\n        API; this will ensure secure access with the least privilege. Service\n        accounts are not assigned passwords that reduce the security’s threat,\n        unlike the API keys, which allow authorized access to the data,\n        including some information that may make you susceptible to a threat.\n      </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n        [:en]These days many businesses still overlook the value of\n        <strong>audio to text</strong> services. You should remember that online\n        audio to text software may assist you in various ways. To make your\n        process simpler, you may swiftly transcribe audio to text instead of\n        entering every single detail. Now is the moment if you have not yet\n        discovered the magic of an online audio text converter. We will go\n        through six reasons why converting <strong>audio to text</strong> is a\n        smart idea today.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Easily Distribute Information</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Typing is a time-consuming activity. Not everyone can type 60 words per\n        minute. As a result, it takes a long time. The more information you want\n        to provide, the more time you’ll need to devote to it. Furthermore, it\n        might lead to exhaustion. Audio to text, on the other hand, is\n        significantly simpler. You can talk for an extended period.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The pace with which one can speak is often quicker than that one can\n        write. Later, you may effortlessly convert an audio recording to text\n        and communicate the information more effectively. You may use an audio\n        file to transcribe large amounts of data swiftly.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Facilitate Easy Knowledge Transfer</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Many firms and offices’ regulations need meticulous documentation of\n        every little detail. Every time you take a break from your board job to\n        write these reports or notes, you risk losing focus. It will\n        significantly diminish your productivity. On the other hand, you may\n        quickly capture audio that you can convert using internet programs. It\n        will guarantee that you can rapidly convey\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information\">information</a>.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Increase Your Reach</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        If you work as a webmaster, transcribing is more of a necessity than a\n        luxury. You will not reach a larger audience if you do not employ\n        transcribing services. You will not be able to outsmart your competitors\n        in this situation. It is one of the most important reasons to employ\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/transcription.php\"><strong>audio to text</strong></a>\n        services.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Journalistic Applications</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Many journalists devote a significant amount of time recording\n        interviews or capturing sound bites. The issue is that they then comb\n        through this footage to make a report or an\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article\">article</a> out of them.\n        You will not have to do it manually if you use tools. Thus, the\n        procedure will be faster.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Help Students Ace Their Classes</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Most universities and colleges are getting more competitive. You cannot\n        afford to miss even one lesson or lecture. The difficulty is that you\n        can miss anything important while cramming notes and listening to the\n        instructor simultaneously. Because of this, it is preferable to record\n        your lectures.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        You will not miss any material if you record the lectures and convert\n        them to text afterwards. It implies that even if you had a momentary\n        loss in focus, you should recover your knowledge from your notes or\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\">book</a>. Submit the audio\n        file to a program, and it will convert it to text for you.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Benefits for Podcasters And Radio Broadcasters</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        If you are not sure why you should transcribe your podcast or radio\n        show, consider this: the text is the quickest method to discover\n        anything on the Internet. Text is usually preferable over audio when it\n        comes to search engines. The benefit of\n        <strong>audio to text</strong> transcription is that it helps search\n        engines index your material using the text that is accessible. Because\n        online searches are text-based, a transcription will provide the user\n        with additional options, such as effortlessly changing your information\n        into articles, presentations, blog posts, articles, presentations, and\n        even books.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        There are 121 languages which are spoken by 10,000 or more people in\n        India, which has a population of 121 crore, it said.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India, said since a\n        household may consist of persons related by blood or of unrelated\n        persons or a mix of both, it is absolutely necessary to ask every person\n        about her or his mother tongue.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        It was required because the mother tongue of each member of a household\n        need not necessarily be the same — these may be different for different\n        members in the household.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The number of such raw returns of mother tongues has totalled 19,569,\n        the report of the 2011 census said. However, 96.71 per cent population\n        in the country have one of the 22 scheduled languages as their mother\n        tongue.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Since mother tongues, as returned in the census, are basically the\n        designations provided by the respondents of the linguistic mediums in\n        which the respondents think they communicate, they need not be identical\n        with the actual linguistic mediums, it said.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The non-scheduled languages are 99 in 2011 against 100 in 2001.

When it\n        comes to translating idioms and metaphors, nothing can substitute human\n        translators, particularly in literary translations.\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_language\">Human language</a>\n        specialists are still in high demand, even though machine converters’\n        productivity cannot be comparable, since human comprehension cannot be\n        substituted in any manner.\n      </p>",

Human\n        translators are better suited for certain translation projects.\n        <strong>Machine translation</strong>, on the other hand, offers\n        significant benefits of its own. With that in mind, consider the\n        following five convincing tips for using machine translation.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Faster</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Machine translation</strong> has several benefits, one of which\n        is speed. Computer software can swiftly translate large volumes of data.\n        Human translators, on the other hand, are more exact yet need much more\n        time to perform the same amount of work.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Less Expensive</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        It is also less costly to use a machine translator than it is to hire a\n        human translator. After all, computers do not demand a minimum hourly\n        salary, thus they are quicker. Professional translators, on the other\n        hand, are specialists who should be paid for their work. The idea is to\n        save that knowledge until when it is required.\n        <strong>Machine translation</strong> may offer you the information you\n        need considerably more inexpensively than a human translator if all you\n        need is a preliminary translation.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Standardize the Code</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        All variables and structured text should be handled the same across the\n        board. A code audit can help you optimize your structure and verify that\n        your API implementation is as simple as possible.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Double-Check Program Integrations</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Not all applications are compatible. Before choosing a platform with an\n        API, double-check for any possible incompatibilities. Build your\n        infrastructure Your API’s task completion maps are called directories.\n        Create thorough directories in all of your target languages to ensure a\n        clear route to follow at all times.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Test Cases</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        If you are new to APIs, it could be helpful to develop some test cases\n        in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> or\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\">XML</a> before implementing\n        them. This technique will assist you in ironing out any faults in your\n        API before it goes live and warns you of any possible problems.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Using an API for<strong> language translation</strong> may bring several\n        advantages, including time-saving and better content. However, you\n        should think about the content and code structure before implementing\n        such software.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Otherwise, you will end up with an API that either does not function or\n        only accomplishes half the job. You can automate most of your project\n        management work and enable leaders to concentrate their attention where\n        it is required most with the correct API based on a solid foundation.[:]\n      </p>",

Keep in mind that online converters can assist you in different ways\n        to do the conversion. Instead of typing every little detail, you may\n        convert audio and image-based documents to text to make your work\n        simpler. Now is the time to check if it’s a good idea to do the\n        conversion or not. Today, this article shares an answer to whether\n        converting image or audio to text is a good idea.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Below are the reasons why the conversion is a good idea in fact for\n          your business:<br/>\n</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p><strong>1. Easily Distribute Information</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Typing is a difficult job. Not everyone can hit 60 wpm on the keyboard.\n        As a result, it is considerably time-consuming. The more information you\n        wish to convey, the more time you will need to spend doing so.\n        Furthermore, tiredness can occur as a consequence of this process.\n        However, it is considerably simpler to convert your audio or image files\n        to text.

        "<p><strong>2. Make knowledge transfer as simple as possible</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Many companies and offices have strict procedures that require you to\n        keep track of every little thing. Every time you divert from your board\n        work to create these reports or notes, it is possible that your\n        attention will lapse. You may record sound from the notes and convert it\n        using conversion tools to text later. It will guarantee that you can\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmit\">transmit</a>\n        information rapidly.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        You can’t reach a larger audience if you don’t use audio and image\n        base-files only. To outsmart your competitors, you have to convert your\n        audio and <strong>images to text</strong> to assist you with such tasks.\n        With the text-based information, you will be able to reach a wide range\n        of audiences.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>4. Journalistic applications</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Many journalists or courts put a lot of time and effort into recording\n        interviews or taking sound bites. There are also image-based documents\n        that can be used during court rulings. This information is required to\n        be stored in text, report, or an article. Through image or\n        <strong>audio to text</strong> conversion, you will do this procedure\n        easily and quickly.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>5. Help students to get detailed content</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Through the conversion, schools and institutions help their students to\n        get the notes since, due to the covid pandemic, most of them have\n        invested in long-distance learning. While taking notes at breakneck\n        speed and listening to the instructor, the issue is that you may\n        overlook something. Due to this very reason, it’s more advisable to\n        record your\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectures\">lectures</a>. There are\n        several advantages to doing so:\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>It’s simple to keep a running note of the entire class.</li>\n<li>\n          You may convert the <strong>audio to text</strong> and make notes.\n        </li>\n<li>You can refer to these instructions as many times as you need.</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<strong>6. Make your content to be ranked high on the internet</strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n        If you’re wondering why you should convert your audio or textbase\n        <strong>images to text</strong>, consider how simple it is to discover\n        stuff on the internet using text. Search engines take advantage of the\n        written word rather than sound or image. The benefit is that since\n        search engines can index your material based on the included text, they\n        can see it more fully.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>7. Less storage</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Having hard copies of your paperwork in your workplace is a waste of\n        time and space in today’s world. If you save the audio or the image base\n        document, it will use up a lot of space on your computer. You will store\n        data in clouds, you’ll need a lot of storage, and there’s less chance of\n        storing more.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        However, converting image base documents and audio to text will save\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_Spaces\">storage space</a>.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        There are several compelling reasons to convert both the audio and\n        <strong>images to text</strong>. Conversion software may truly simplify\n        your life. Both business people, a student, a podcaster, or a\n        broadcaster, can use conversion tools. It’s time to start utilizing such\n        technologies to your advantage rather than underestimating their\n        potentials.[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]Technology has played a significant role in language translation.\n        The invention of machine translation caused a high turnover in language\n        translation.\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/machine-translation.php\"><strong>Machine translation</strong></a>\n        is a computerized device that uses software to translate various\n        languages. The software used in the machine is called translation API.\n        Several gains can be linked to these machines. These machines have\n        played a major role in websites because businesses have created\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingual\">multilingual</a>\n        accounts through them. There is different software depending on the type\n        of machine.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The following are advantages of <strong>machine translation</strong>:\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Speed Of Production</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        The translation of languages is a whole workload. When using machine\n        translation, it can translate a large volume of words at once. Their\n        translation speed is higher than a human translator, and it is done\n        using translation API commands.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>It Lowers The Cost Of Production</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Buying a <strong>machine translation</strong> may require a large\n        investment, but it becomes a fixed cost of production once it is\n        purchased. This means that it will generate more revenue in the long\n        run. Compared to human translation, machine translation is cheap because\n        of its speed and the human labour required. Also, in areas where more\n        than one\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a> needs to\n        be translated, the machine will be more affordable than hiring different\n        translators.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>It Can Translate More Than One Language</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        One of the primary <strong>advantages of machine translation</strong> is\n        its capacity to translate into a wide range of languages. Translation in\n        several languages saves time and money while working on a project that\n        does not necessitate a human translation but does need to be translated\n        into numerous languages. It would rapidly become prohibitively expensive\n        and time-consuming to hire an actual human translator for each of these\n        languages.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>Saves Time</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        With the help of translation software, you can quickly and easily\n        translate complete text documents. Human translation is far more\n        time-consuming, mainly if a dictionary is used to seek out specific\n        meanings, but machine translation may save you time in many cases.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>It Can Be Customized</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Translation machines can be adjusted according to the target to\n        accommodate various key terms. They provide settings to execute a\n        translation and send it off automatically. These settings allow the user\n        to switch between multiple customs to modify the content.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>It Stores Different Keywords</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        A significant advantage of machine translation is that it can record and\n        re-use common terms and phrases used within a specific business.

        "<p>\n        This article will describe the four different\n        <strong>types of translation</strong> and how they function.

        "<h3>\n<strong>The four most common types of translation are as follows:</strong>\n</h3>",
        "<ul>\n<li>Literary translation</li>\n<li>Professional translation</li>\n<li>Technical Translation</li>\n<li>Administrative translation</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        We go into more depth about each of them in the sections below so that\n        you have a better grasp of what they are.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>\n<strong>Literary Translation</strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n        As the term Literary translation suggests, this kind of translation is\n        concerned with the translation of literary works such as tales, poetry,\n        plays, etc. This <strong>type of translation</strong> is often regarded\n        as the most difficult or most complete since the translator must\n        accurately convey the content of the words and the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context\">context</a>, tone, and\n        emotion conveyed by the words.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The amount of information and expertise required for this is, as you\n        would expect, considerable. Furthermore, it may still be difficult even\n        after that since there are certain instances in which there are no\n        appropriate translations. For example, in poetry, when the rhyming of\n        words or puns is used to add more wordplay, it is often found that it\n        does not function in the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_language\">target language</a>.\n      </p>",

We would consider\n        ourselves to be in this group if we were to translate anything for a\n        professional purpose of any kind. A medical translation or a\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\"><strong>legal translation</strong></a>\n        are two examples of what is often done.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The primary aim in this situation is typically to ensure that all of the\n        material is translated as precisely as possible. In contrast to literary\n        translations, papers will not include any wordplay, such as puns or\n        rhymes, which will make the translator’s job a little bit simpler.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Complicated professions, such as those mentioned above, may often need\n        an expert to guarantee accuracy. Of course, this is dependent on the\n        subject matter, but the more complicated the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_language\">original language</a>\n        is, the more trained the translator must be to communicate effectively.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Technical translations are, as the name implies, equally technical.

Because search\n        engines cannot interpret video material properly, they depend heavily on\n        the surrounding text. Text from subtitles, captions, or interactive\n        transcripts will boost your search-ability well beyond your rivals, and\n        if you include translations, you will have a\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global\">global</a> appeal.\n      </p>",

Along with organizations that provide high-quality services,\n        numerous unreliable operators in the market are just interested in\n        making a fast profit, sometimes at the expense of their naïve customers\n        getting subpar results. As a result, you should keep your eyes open when\n        hiring a <strong>machine translation</strong> service provider, and here\n        are four things to consider when selecting a translation services firm.\n      </p>",

        "<h3><strong>Cultural Understanding</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        While you may hire <strong>machine translation</strong> services from\n        anywhere globally, it is preferable to employ native translators. Hiring\n        a native linguist may help you in a variety of ways.\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native\">Native</a> translators\n        have a greater knowledge of culture and way of life, which is\n        particularly essential if you intend to enter a new market with your\n        product. When selecting an agency, always insist on meeting the\n        translator working on your project since the outcome will depend\n        entirely on their abilities and mastery of the language.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Expertise</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Lack of knowledge about this aspect is one of the reasons why many\n        companies and individuals make poor decisions when choosing\n        <strong>machine translation services</strong> providers. While strong\n        command of the language is an important talent that any translator\n        should have, they should also have a solid understanding of the subject\n        they are working on. A translator who got rave reviews from their client\n        after translating a novel may not be the ideal option for interpreting a\n        legal document. When looking for a translator, you should thoroughly\n        investigate their credentials.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        One of the essential characteristics to look for in a <strong>m</strong><strong>achine translation service</strong> provider is the number of\n        languages they support. While they must be fluent in the two languages\n        relevant to your project, choosing an agency with experience in\n        additional languages is part of planning. If you want to expand into new\n        areas in the future, it is always better to collaborate with an agency\n        that works in all main\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">languages</a> across\n        the globe. If you require another language in the future, you will not\n        have to go through the same agency selection procedure or deal with two\n        separate agencies, which will add to your difficulties.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Turnaround Time</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        In business, getting something done on time may be the difference\n        between tremendous success and mediocrity. As a result, you should\n        constantly consider the turnaround time that the\n        <strong>machine translation</strong> agency guarantees. Cooperate with\n        agencies that stick to tight deadlines and accept penalty terms in the\n        event of a delay. This demonstrates professionalism as well as the\n        agency’s ability to handle a project of your size. Agencies that do not\n        adhere to tight deadlines often hunt for freelancers after taking on a\n        new project and therefore have little control over quality.\n      </p>",

You should avoid agencies that use pricing as their main\n        differentiator. On the other hand, agencies that charge the most may be\n        charging you more than they should.\n      </p>",

This entails translating the source material into an\n        easy-to-work-with file format (usually RTF), applying a translation\n        memory (TM) to the text to automatically translate whatever the tool has\n        already translated, and filling in the gaps from fresh.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        To guarantee the quality, the translator may use glossaries and\n        translation style guide templates to go through each part of the text.\n        Finally, they will have another linguist review the translation before\n        converting the finished written document back into its original format\n        to ensure the best possible fit.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        On-the-spot interpretation takes time to occur. The procedure may be\n        carried out in person, over the phone, or through video. Translation, on\n        the other hand, may occur after the original text has been produced.\n        This allows translators plenty of time to use technology and reference\n        materials to produce accurate, high-quality translations.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Translation and Interpretation Accuracy</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Interpretation requires a somewhat lower degree of precision than\n        translating. Interpreters strive for perfection, but it is not easy to\n        accomplish in a live setting—for example, part of the original speech\n        may be left out of the target\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\">language</a>. Again,\n        time is on the side of translators when examining and revising written\n        material for correctness.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Direction</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Interpreters must be proficient in both the source and destination\n        languages since they must interpret in both directions instantly without\n        reference materials. Professional translators usually only operate in\n        one direction: into their native language.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Intangibles</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Both interpreters and translators confront the difficulty of making\n        metaphors, analogies, and idioms connect with the intended audience. In\n        addition, interpreters must capture the tone, inflexions, voice quality,\n        and other distinguishing features of the spoken word and communicate\n        these verbal signals to the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience\">audience</a>.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Dubbing is the process of fully replacing an original recording with a\n        recorded translation.

        "<p>\n        Merriam Webster dictionary defines interpretation as the “action of\n        explaining the meaning of something; the way something is explained or\n        understood.” Well, the definition seems like a tongue twister of\n        ‘somethings.’ Nonetheless, the underlying implication is that\n        interpretation is the assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal\n        language.\n      </p>",

A language\n        interpreter or a signed language interpreter’s objective is to interpret\n        the meaning of a text carefully and transfer the original text’s tone,\n        intent, and motivation within the targeted or interpreted language.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        According to the interpretive planner and trainer John A.

        "<h2>Types of Interpretation</h2>",
        "<p>\n        The primal essence of interpretation is conveying information from a\n        source language into a target language. This relay of knowledge can be\n        achieved in multiple ways and depend upon the needs of the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker\">speakers </a>and\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeners\">listeners</a>.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Simultaneous Interpretation</strong> – In this interpretation,\n          the interpreter listens to spoken content through headphones and\n          speaks the interpreted words into a microphone. As soon as the\n          interpreter grasps the general meaning of the statement, they begin\n          their interpretation process. Simultaneous interpretation can be\n          easily seen in award shows and beauty pageants. Interestingly, the\n          first use of simultaneous interpretation using electronic pieces of\n          equipment was a part of the Nuremberg Trials.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consecutive Interpretation</strong> – In consecutive\n          interpretation, the speaker speaks for a while and then pauses for\n          five minutes or so. The interpreter takes notes within the paused time\n          and then forwards the communication. A crucial skill required in\n          consecutive interpretation is note-taking.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Whispered Interpretation</strong> – It is a variant of\n          simultaneous interpretation, which entails the interpreter addressing\n          a small target language audience by whispering a simultaneous\n          interpretation. This type of interpretation is viable when a few\n          audience members do not speak the\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_language\">source language</a>.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relay Interpretation</strong> – Similar to a relay race, relay\n          interpretation involves a small number of participants. A\n          source-language interpreter transfers the message to a group of\n          interpreters who speak the source and the different target languages.\n          After that, these interpreters convey or ‘relay’ the message to their\n          respective audiences. For instance, an English text is interpreted in\n          Hindi by a group of interpreters, who then interpret it into Kannada,\n          Bengali, etc., to their respective clientele.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Liaison Interpretation</strong> – Alternately known as escort\n          interpreting, liaison interpretation depends upon an interpreter who\n          translates into and out of the source and target languages while the\n          conversation is going on. This interpretation type is suitable for\n          small and informal situations.\n        </li>\n</ul>",

        "<h2>Interpretation and Translation – The Difference</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Although<strong> interpretation and translation</strong> are used\n        interchangeably many times, they have stark differences that we need to\n        acknowledge.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n          The fundamental difference is that interpretation deals with spoken\n          language in real-time, whereas translation is text-based.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          The delivery of interpretation happens on the spot. It is spontaneous\n          communication that may occur in person, over the phone, or via video\n          calls. The\n          <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com\">translation</a></strong> is a\n          long-term process that may take months to complete.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Moreover, the accuracy requirement in interpretation is lower as\n          compared to translation. The real-time dynamic associated with\n          interpretation compels some slippages in meanings and context.\n          Translation, on the contrary, is spot on when it comes to accuracy, as\n          the translated document is a physical entity that can be edited and\n          revised.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Another crucial\n          <strong>difference between interpretation and translation</strong> is\n          the direction. Interpreters must be phenomenally fluent in both the\n          source language and the target language, whereas translators typically\n          work unidirectionally into their\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother-tongue\">mother tongue</a>.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        If we step aside from the differences, a common challenge that both\n        interpreters and translators face is making metaphors, analogies, and\n        idioms resonate with the target audience.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong> Interpreters</strong> and translators are mandated to capture\n        the tone, inflections, and motivation of their source document, which\n        is, to be honest, quite a daunting task. Nonetheless, relaying verbal\n        cues is essential for interpreters, and spontaneity makes them apart\n        from usual translators.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        In case you are looking for an <strong>interpreter</strong>, choose\n        someone with ample experience. You can also look for credible\n        certification and specialization. When dealing with an agency that\n        provides <strong>interpretation services</strong>, transparent policies,\n        accommodative practices, and open communication are a few of the vital\n        qualities that you ought to be looking for.

The source ‘text’ of transcription can either be verbal or\n        written. In simple words,<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/transcription.php\"><strong>transcription</strong></a>\n        is a document crafted by typing everything uttered either in an\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio\">audio</a> or\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video\">video</a>.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Since the 1990s, with the rise of the World Wide Web and social media\n        platforms, we can see a boom in audio and video content. This shift from\n        written video to audio-video media has made transcription all the more\n        critical. We can gauge the paramount<strong>\n          importance of the transcription industry from the fact that it is\n          currently valued at USD 19.8 billion and is expected to grow at an\n          annual rate of 6 percent from 2020 to 2027.</strong>\n</p>",

The filler words like ‘ah,’ ‘ahm,’ ‘oh,’\n        etc., are included in the transcript document. Stutters, repetitions,\n        interjections are all a lively part of the transcription.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        We can witness the supremacy and widespread popularity of strict\n        verbatim transcription in domains of Law, Police and Legal Enforcement,\n        Market Research, Films, Advertising,\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources\">Human Resources</a>, Recruitment, and so on.

Well,\n        specific industries heavily rely on complete and accurate information\n        for their daily operations. For example, the law requires transcription\n        of proceedings, hearings, and so on. Similarly, the police force needs\n        the immaculate transcription of witnesses.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Intelligent Verbatim Transcription</strong> – Alternately known\n        as non-verbatim transcription, intelligent verbatim transcription is a\n        style of transcription that involves omissions. The transcriber has some\n        degree of independence to omit laughter, utterances, and filler words.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The transcriber can also polish incomplete sentences of the audio or\n        video file whenever they deem fit. The exclusions associated with\n        non-verbatim transcription do not mean that the final transcript is\n        incomplete. The thumb rule in intelligent verbatim transcription is to\n        capture the\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message\">message</a> and essence\n        of the video’s audio and keep them intact.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The transcriber removes the ostensibly distracting aspects of the source\n        document. The motivation behind the non-verbatim transcription is to\n        present a clean version of the otherwise chaotic audio or video for\n        readability and preciseness.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        We can observe that non-verbatim transcription is most commonly utilized\n        in businesses and medical spheres. In such fields, the utterances,\n        pauses, and filler words do not have much significance, and they are\n        easily ignored. Moreover, non-verbatim transcription is also used in\n        podcasts,\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_speeches\">speeches</a>,\n        meetings, and conferences.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Edited Transcription</strong> – In this transcription style,\n        certain parts of the audio or video file that are unimportant or\n        non-essential can be excluded. The transcriber has considerable leeway\n        to remove aspects of the source file that they deem repetitive or\n        trivial.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        But, it is noteworthy that despite the lacuna in edited transcriptions,\n        the document’s original message, essence, and intent must remain intact.\n        A transcriber involved in edited transcription must swiftly de-clutter\n        the chaos of the source audio or video and present a clean and polished\n        version of the same.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        They need to possess the expertise and skill of grasping the purpose and\n        intent of the audio or video file’s message and take stringent decisions\n        on what is essential and what is not.\n        <strong>Edited transcription</strong> is commonly used in publishing\n        houses, academia, speeches, and conferences. These are the domains that\n        have the luxury to omit unnecessary parts of the source file. Clarity,\n        conciseness, and readability are the crucial aspects of edited\n        transcription.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Phonetic Transcription</strong> – This type of transcription\n        notes the way spoken words are pronounced using phonetic symbols. We\n        know that the English language has 26 alphabets, but approximately 44\n        unique sounds are called phonemes. Well, the pertinent question now is\n        what a phoneme is? It is the smallest unit of speech that can make one\n        word different from another.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The <strong>phonetic translation</strong> is used when the aim is to\n        retain the dialect in which the original words were spoken. For example,\n        if a transcriber engages with a period movie wherein the dialogues are\n        not in modern English and the word ‘quandary’ is often used, the\n        transcriber would exercise phonetic transcription on the word’\n        quandary.’\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>Audio files</strong> – Audio files like recordings and podcasts\n        are commonly transcribed into readable, written texts.

        "<p>\n<strong>Video files</strong> –\n        <strong>Video transcription</strong> involves converting a video or a\n        film’s audio track into a written document.

It means a product, service, site, or content with the\n        socio-economic, cultural, and linguistic tastes of a particular region\n        or ‘locale.’ The process of localizing a site entails refining the\n        flagship website to suit the unique preferences of audiences that are\n        different from the original target\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population\">population</a>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        We can say that localization is the opposite of globalization, but the\n        former strengthens the latter and vice versa. If you are looking for\n        quality <strong>website localization</strong>, be attentive to\n        socio-cultural nuances pertinent to your region of interest. Many a\n        time, localization and translation are interchangeably used, but both of\n        these processes are quite distinct from one another.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Translation does not need to be culturally intricate; it has some\n        considerable leeway when adapting to a specific locale. On the contrary,\n        paying meticulous attention to the target culture is the USP of\n        localization. Culture, history, economy, religion, ethnicity, customs,\n        and tastes are the essence of localization.\n      </p>",

It is a highly specialized and complex\n        mechanism that involves technology and language in equal parts.\n      </p>",

Moreover, the site’s payment\n        processing system, currency changes, etc. are also part of the\n        technological aspect. On the flipside, localizing a site transcends\n        mainly linguistic concerns and encapsulates local and regional\n        sensibilities.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The unprecedented boom of internet-related services has galvanized\n        localization and turned it into an inevitable step for professional\n        success and global expansion.

        "<p>\n        Localization is for anyone attempting to inflate their business and\n        reach new audiences.

However, there remain\n        very few human civilizations untouched by innovations and gadgetry.\n        Contemporary times are marked by an unabashed dependence on technology,\n        especially phones.

Initially intended for functions related\n        to mails, calendars, and databases; the aura of ‘apps’ has encapsulated\n        every domain imaginable. For example, some apps exist to remind users to\n        drink water, apps that help count calories, or hi-tech gaming apps\n        compared to Sony Play stations.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n<strong>Mobile app localization</strong> is adapting an app and its app\n        store listings to cater to diverse geographical locations and target\n        audiences. Localizing a mobile app is intrinsically linked to its growth\n        and expansion. It enables an app to reach more people and makes it\n        relatable and appealing to foreign audiences. If you are looking for\n        <strong>mobile app translation</strong>, opt for an agency with credible\n        certification and expertise in the field.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The primary objective of an app developer is to increase the app’s\n        visibility and exposure, and effective localization is the optimal\n        method of achieving these crucial goals. Furthermore, translating an app\n        to match specific locales’ linguistic and socio-cultural tastes\n        profoundly increases its MAU (monthly active users), thereby increasing\n        revenue.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        It is noteworthy to highlight that mobile app localization helps break\n        linguistic barriers and enables the developer to fully utilize the\n        socio-political and cultural nuances of a region to the best possible\n        extent. We can gauge the importance of\n        <strong>mobile app translation</strong> because localized apps result in\n        128 percent more downloads per country and a 26 percent increase in\n        revenue for each country.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Localization</strong> allows the app to move beyond the original\n        user base and access a global market. For example, a recent study\n        illustrates that 50 percent of the countries within the top 10 downloads\n        and revenue in iOS, and 80 percent of the countries within the top five\n        for downloads and profits in the Play Store are non-English speaking\n        regions from Europe and East Asia.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The app industry is characterized by fierce competition with new\n        applications every hot minute. The appropriate technique to stay a step\n        ahead of the rest is via localization. Studies say that if a netizen\n        deletes an app in 90 percent of the cases, there remains a very faint\n        possibility for re-downloading.

        "<p>\n<strong>Mobile app localization</strong> is essential to polish a\n        brand’s image globally. Due to infallible localization, gaming apps like\n        Pokémon Go and social media applications like Instagram and Facebook\n        have become worldwide sensations. However, numbers do not lie, and they\n        reflect that 41 percent of global app revenue comes from Asia, followed\n        by North America (31 percent) and Europe (23 percent). Therefore,\n        catering to the non-English speaking Asian and European areas becomes\n        paramount.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Thus, the legroom for expansion increases as one demarcates territories\n        and tweaks the app to match them.

        "<p>\n        It is noteworthy to mention that localization is more than translation.\n        In addition to words and grammar, localizing any entity involves\n        changing the direction of the text, colors of the font, altering the\n        images, videos, and sounds, and personalizing scenarios and examples to\n        make everything more relatable.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Do you need localization?</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Localization</strong> is for anyone attempting to expand their\n        business and reach new clientele. Localized content is more relatable\n        and compels audiences to bask in its appeal. Studies reveal that 75\n        percent of netizens are more likely to purchase from a website whose\n        customer care services are in their <strong>native languages</strong>.\n      </p>",

More and more customers automatically become a part of\n          your brand through localization that is swift and influential. Studies\n          illustrate that 40 percent of Internet users will never purchase any\n          service or product from a site that is not in their\n          <strong>vernacular language</strong>. Such glaring figures reflect the\n          paramount <strong>importance of localization</strong> in the 21st\n          Century.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Another factor that will motivate you to invest in localization is\n          global domination. Reaching out to international audiences with\n          content and products compatible with their tastes, preferences, and\n          socio-cultural setup will surely help calcify a firm position in the\n          global market. Every business requires website localization and other\n          related processes from multi-million dollar MNCs like\n          <strong>PepsiCo and McDonalds to local startups</strong>.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Better ROI is a crucial merit of localization. If you are struggling\n          in a foreign market, localization is the ‘knight in shining armor to\n          sweep away your marketing woes. Numbers don’t lie, and 57 percent of\n          customers stated that the ability to procure information is more\n          important than price. Moreover, many businesses are still unable to\n          peer beyond English-centrism, and localizing will, undoubtedly, give\n          you the first-mover advantage in many professional realms.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        Thus, we can convincingly state that localization is a foolproof weapon\n        that yields insurmountable benefits.

        "<p>\n        [:en]A part of our day-to-day lexicon – translation is a\n        multidimensional and dynamic process whose history is as old as human\n        civilization. It is the process of communicating the meaning of a source\n        text written in a particular language to another language.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The word translation is extracted from the Latin word ‘translation,\n        which we can bifurcate as ‘trans’ meaning ‘across’ and ‘ferre’ meaning\n        ‘to carry’. Thus, the etymology of the word is self-explanatory and\n        apparent.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Translation has two rudimentary aspects – source language and target\n        language. The former refers to the linguistic composition of the\n        original document, and the latter is the language to which the document\n        has to be translated.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Before getting into the Nitty-gritty of translation types such as\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><strong>document translation</strong></a>, let us first glance over the historical overview of the process.\n      </p>",

        "<h2>History Overview of Translation – When did it All Began?</h2>",
        "<p>\n        We can trace the history of translation back to the 3rd century BCE\n        Mesopotamian civilization wherein the Sumerian poem – The Epic of\n        Gilgamesh was translated into Asian languages.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Two other archaic works of translation include the Septuagint and the\n        bible translated by St. Jerome. Europe and Asia both had a tremendous\n        role in utilizing and enriching translation.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        For example, Buddhist monks translated the Indian sutras into Chinese\n        during the ancient period, and Romans translated ancient Greek texts.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        In addition, the Arabic scholars played a pivotal role in translating\n        the literary Magnum Opuses of Greek philosophers that were obscured from\n        Europe during the Dark Ages.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Interestingly, the\n        <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic\">Arabic</a></strong>\n        versions were re-translated into\n        <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\">Latin</a></strong>\n        during the Middle Ages, mainly throughout Spain, and this entire process\n        culminated into the Renaissance of the 17th century. Modern history is\n        the witness to an unprecedented significance of translation.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The salient feature of translation post-1950 is the rise of automation\n        and machine translation. Solely manual translation became so laborious a\n        process that engineers and innovators were compelled to step in.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        In 1954, the Georgetown-IBM experiment demonstrated the powers of\n        <strong>machine translation</strong> when the machine converted 60\n        Russian sentences into English within a minute.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The presence of machine-oriented\n        <strong>translation services</strong> skyrocketed with the advent of the\n        Internet in 1990. Factors such as globalization, postmodernism,\n        liberalization, and international trade have made translation services\n        into a USD 39.61 Billion industry as of 2019.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>Types of Translation</h2>",
        "<p>\n        1. <strong> Localizing a website</strong> has gained phenomenal\n        eminence since the 1990s. The process of\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><strong>website localization</strong></a>\n        entails adapting an existing website into the socio-cultural and\n        linguistic context of the target region.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        It involves a holistic modification that only reflects apt linguistic\n        variations but is also attuned to the cultural underpinnings of the\n        targeted clientele. The prime objective of localizing is to customize\n        the website so that its regional contents appear seamless, natural, and\n        rustic.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        We can gauge the significance of localization because 72 percent of\n        netizens prefer to browse websites formulated in their native language.\n        With countries like China and India emerging as voracious Internet\n        consumers, multilingualism in websites has become an unavoidable step\n        for achieving success.\n      </p>",

        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        2. A highly specialized translation type,\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\"><strong>legal translation services</strong></a>\n        are the heart and soul of cross-country judicial networking. Contrary to\n        the normative practice, translating a legal document requires utmost\n        sophistication as well as certification.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        It is usually done by a translator who possesses intense knowledge of\n        the law and the two languages involved. Various countries have different\n        standards for accepting <strong>translated legal documents</strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        For instance, several nations like Venezuela, Turkey, Mexico, etc.,\n        require legal translators to perform a swearing-in ceremony and register\n        with the presiding authority.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        On the other hand, few countries like the UK and the USA have no\n        oath-taking ceremonies for legal translators, and the official rules are\n        also less stringent. If you are looking for\n        <strong>legal translation</strong>, remember that credible certification\n        is a must, along with experience.\n      </p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        3. Marketing a technical product on a site other than the original\n        country necessitates <strong>technical translation</strong>. The process\n        involves translating the technical documentation of an entity from one\n        language to another.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Some of the commonly translated technical texts are product data sheets,\n        user manuals, maintenance manuals, operative systems, product\n        descriptions, and so forth. The need for technical translation is\n        constantly increasing.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        While opting for an agency that offers technical translation, you must\n        analyze the training and expertise of the translators by nudging their\n        familiarity with the technological and scientific jargon of the\n        particular industry. The intricacies involved in technical translation\n        are immense, as even a minuscule mistake can lead to the loss of\n        <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millions\">millions</a></strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        4. The mobile application industry is witnessing a global boom and is\n        currently valued at USD 107 billion.

        "<p>\n        Studies show that translating an app increases downloads by 300-400\n        times. In simple terms, localizing an app means converting its contents\n        to suit the socio-cultural and linguistic ambiance of the target region.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Research illustrates that 50 percent of the countries within the top 10\n        for downloads and revenue in iOS and 80 percent of the countries within\n        the top five for downloads and profit in Google Play Store are\n        non-English speaking nations from Europe and East Asia.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Thus, creating an unwavering English-language mobile app is no longer\n        viable. While looking for\n        <strong>mobile app translation services</strong>, choose an agency that\n        has worked in this translation niche. Furthermore, positive reviews,\n        transparent communication, and accommodating service providers are\n        always good signs.\n      </p>",

        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        5. <strong>Medical translation</strong> is another niche of translation\n        that has taken the world by storm.

It also helps healthcare providers\n        implement the necessary treatments on patients who do not speak their\n        native language. As such, trustworthiness is a highly esteemed value in\n        the medical translation industry.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        It is crucial for medical translation to be performed by experienced\n        personnel who are professionals in the medical field. Due to the\n        life-and-death context, human translators still reign supreme in the\n        domain of medical translation services.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        If you plan to hire\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><strong>website localization services</strong></a>, make sure to opt for an agency that is credible, accommodative, and\n        recognized.\n      </p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        6. <strong>Script translation</strong> is an eminent process in the\n        entertainment industry. It helps a particular video or movie to reach a\n        wider audience. The method of script translation also makes subtitling\n        easier and quicker. We all know the importance of subtitles, especially\n        for the deaf community.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Even in general circumstances, studies show that people prefer to watch\n        content with subtitles on. The process of video subtitling has garnered\n        phenomenal significance. But, it is noteworthy to mention that quality\n        script translation is the predecessor to successful subtitling.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        If you want a reliable and accurate\n        <strong>document translation</strong>, please ensure that the agency you\n        choose specializes in the subject area of the document that has to be\n        translated.\n      </p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<p>\n        Translation has become an ingrained part of the 21st century.

        "<p>\n        We can see an unprecedented rise in the importance of\n        <strong>document translation</strong> in the 21st century. It is one of\n        the most effective methods of bridging cultural, social, political and\n        ethnic gulfs. Dedicated efforts towards translation can actualize\n        gainful knowledge-sharing.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Moreover, accelerating translation practices creates a unique\n        sensitivity to the cultural warehouse residing dormant in other\n        languages. It is, indeed, the faculty that brings us closer to foreign\n        cultures and societies not only through written media but also via\n        movies, music, and so on.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Let us look at some points that concretize the veritable significance of\n        translation in contemporary times.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>1.</strong> English is the third most widely spoken native\n        language with 330 million speakers. Currently, there exist 7000\n        languages all over the world and focusing on one of them is unfair, to\n        say the least. Even within regions assumed to be English-centric, large\n        chunks of the population converse in other languages.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        For example, England, which is home to a comprehensive English speaking\n        population, harbours linguistic minorities. Moreover, just because a\n        person can speak English does not imply that they can efficiently\n        communicate in the language. For example, a 2012 survey reveals that\n        only 23 percent of\n        <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeans\">Europeans</a></strong>\n        understand English well enough to follow an English-language news\n        broadcast.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Likewise, studies show that 65 percent of netizens prefer to browse\n        sites in their native language despite being proficient in English.\n        Another study in India confirmed that three-fourths of Indians warrant\n        content in their native language. Therefore, we can lucidly see the\n        ubiquitous importance of <strong>document translation</strong> all over\n        the world.\n      </p>",

Moreover, 880000 small British businesses are expected to\n        transcend to foreign markets by 2025.

Let us look at some of the steps involved in<strong>\n          website localization</strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>1. Planning</strong> – Research shows that 4.5 billion people\n        use the internet every day and the most prominent user pool comes from\n        Asia, America and Europe. The underlying expectation is to stick to\n        English because it is a ‘global language. But, there are 7000 languages\n        globally, and obsessively focusing on just one of them is unjust,\n        unviable, and an opportunity lost.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Seventy-two percent of netizens spend most of their time surfing\n        websites in their native language. Moreover, 65 percent of internet\n        users who are proficient in <strong>English</strong> are likely to\n        repurchase from a site if the proceeding communication is done in their\n        local language.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Thus, localizing a website is fundamental to elevate business repute,\n        reach and credibility. Planning is the most critical step of the entire\n        process, and we must remember that less is more. While designing a\n        website, it is essential to keep some room for\n        <strong>website localization</strong> by making the flagship site\n        flexible. Keeping more space in the web site’s page layout and including\n        fewer yet relevant images and videos are the secrets for successful\n        <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\">localization</a></strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>2. Market stratagem</strong> – The cost of localization depends\n        on the number of languages and target regions involved. It may seem like\n        a win-all situation to hop onto the localization current in full swing\n        with all the glorious advantages.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        But, a good market stratagem is vital before you proceed with\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><strong>website localization</strong></a>. Understanding the customer base and knowing their preferred language\n        is all you need to focus on. For instance, if your clientele is\n        concentrated in France, China, and India, you can choose to localize\n        your website as per the linguistic priorities of these three countries.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The key is to avoid generic content and be sensitive to the social\n        thread of your target market. For example, broccoli – a vegetable\n        despised by European and American children – is loved by Japanese\n        children. This unique cultural distinction can play a massive role in\n        the marketing tactics for children-oriented items.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Similarly, if you want to opt for\n        <strong>mobile app translation</strong>, ask yourself some simple\n        questions like – Is your app popular in the concerned market, what is\n        the level of competition there, and cost of translation, and so forth.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>3. Teamwork</strong> – Localizing a website has numerous\n        stakeholders, making the entire process even more complex. Your budget\n        decides the size of your team, but a smaller group does not imply lesser\n        efficacy.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Some intelligent decisions like personally doing the market research,\n        consulting a locale of the target market to extract more information,\n        and checking Google Analytics can provide respite to your pocket.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        But, it is imperative not to cut corners while translating the site’s\n        content. Lastly, a collaborative team willing to swiftly collaborate\n        over different time zones can make all the difference during\n        <strong>website localization</strong>.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>4. Search Engine Optimization</strong> – Preparing keywords for\n        the new market is vital to increase the reach and traffic of the\n        website. International SEO can make a sea-difference in how locals\n        perceive your website and how Google engages with it.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        A well-optimized website with relevant and well-spaced keywords can\n        bring you to the top searches. Lastly, it is paramount to test the\n        website before the final launch.

        "<p>\n        Therefore, we can safely conclude that localizing a website is the\n        optimal method of overseas expansion. If you are looking to localize\n        your site, make sure that you opt for a credible company that is\n        flexible, accountable and credible.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>Undoubtedly, over the past decade, India has transformed itself in\n          the digital forum drastically. As a result, the technology startup\n          ecosystem has seen a prominent growth trajectory. Moreover, the\n          ongoing tech revolution has surfaced\n          <strong>deep technologies</strong> that will be at the forefront of\n          the next wave of information disruption. It’s also the next major\n          thing that both corporations and venture investors\n          desire.  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span><strong>DeepTech</strong> is a counterword for\n          <strong>Deep Technologies</strong>. It’s a common term for\n          technologies based on scientific or engineering developments and has\n          the ability to be commercialized. They aim to solve the most\n          complicated challenges worldwide. To put it simply,\n          <strong>DeepTech</strong> refers to <strong>startups</strong> whose\n          business objects are based on high-tech innovation employing the\n          latest technological advances in several domains. Currently, 19% of\n          tech startups are leveraging <strong>DeepTech solutions</strong> to\n          construct product proficiencies for their market expansion.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Due to this, deep technology possesses the power to establish its own\n          markets and disrupt existing industries. One of the main reasons why\n          <strong>DeepTech companies</strong> are being built in India is the\n          appearance of a cohesive ecosystem. Allowing the growth of these\n          startups consist of the availability of talent and investors who are\n          willing to support them. The major benefit of\n          <strong>DeepTech solutions</strong> is their potential to shape the\n          foundations for future industries that emerging markets such as India\n          need. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>‘<strong>India Emerging Deep Tech Global Hub</strong>’, where the\n          startup landscape in India is put under the spotlight.\n          <strong>Devnagri Co-Founder, Himanshu Sharma</strong> took the\n          initiative to talk about his journey of building his startup on a\n          panel discussion on ‘<strong>India Emerging Deep Tech Global Hub</strong>’ on <strong>DD India</strong>. He explained how\n          <strong>Devnagri</strong> has become a leading translation platform to\n          help diverse industries and businesses reach more than\n          <strong>1 billion Indian internet users</strong> in their respective\n          <strong>regional languages</strong>. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Moreover, <strong>Himanshu Sharma</strong> is a social adept who has\n          spent 12 years as an entrepreneur and acquired experience in almost\n          every business area including,\n          <strong>business strategy, marketing, operations, business\n            intelligence</strong>\n          and more. Most prominent recognitions include Winner\n          <strong>NASSCOM-Emerge 50 League of 10 [2020]</strong> Featured by\n          <strong>YourStory, Member Of NASSCOM DeepTech Club</strong> etc.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The significant challenges concerning <strong>DeepTech</strong> stem\n          from the complications of the technology commercialization procedure\n          and can be implanted into three broad categories; prolonged timeline,\n          restricted availability of social and physical infrastructure, and\n          lack of capital. That’s why <strong>Himanshu Sharma</strong> has taken\n          multiple initiatives to encourage the\n          <strong>AI-Technology revolution in India</strong>; his contribution\n          to the <strong>Entrepreneurial</strong> Space is highly\n          appreciated.<br/> </span>[:]\n      </p>",

Hire a Document Translation company to carry out the\n        precise translation for your document and localize it to reflect the\n        target countries’ cultural nuances. Here is what you should look out for\n        when hiring a\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><strong>Document Localization</strong></a>\n        company to meet the scope of your project.\n      </p>",

        "<p>There is a clear line between translation and localization.</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n          Translation is a process where the source version of any content is\n          changed to a target language using the proper syntax that makes it\n          clear for the viewers or readers.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Localization is the process of translating and adapting to the\n          different content forms as per the particular local culture. Context\n          has a key role to play here. Localization involves taking the formal\n          or the informal setting also into consideration. It is important to\n          make sense with the right meaning to bring out the complete emotion in\n          the particular cultural and local setting to improve the effectiveness\n          of what is being communicated.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\">Translation</a> and\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\">localization</a>\n        are different, but they support each other mutually. You cannot localize\n        every element without language.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Choosing The Right Localization Service Provider</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        Not everyone can be a language expert, and this stands true for the\n        native speakers as well. It is thus important to carefully consider\n        those who would be involved in the\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/why-document-translation-is-need-of-todays-era/\">document translation process</a>. The translators should be good at communication. They should be\n        masters at the local language and the culture of the target place and\n        know about your company and your brand.\n      </p>",
        "<h4>\n<strong>The Importance of The Project Deadline Should Be Reiterated</strong>\n</h4>",
        "<p>\n        The translation service provider should adhere to the project deadline\n        right from the start to the end. They should complete the localization\n        within the specific deadline.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        The SMEs are capable of fully capturing the details and the essence of\n        the original material. The translator, an SME, will have the eviction\n        and the technical training to comprehend the message and offer reliable\n        and accurate translation.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        In contrast, the translator who only has some rudimentary knowledge of\n        the subject poses a risk. There could be phrases and words common to the\n        particular field that may be difficult to translate, leaving back an\n        inaccurate and poorly translated document.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        This leaves the company with a document that fails to meet the desired\n        standards and in turn, does not give the brand the expected result.\n      </p>",

The reader will not\n        understand the transliterated language if he does not know the original\n        language. It is only when the word is translated into the language that\n        the reader knows will he be able to understand what the word means.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Basically, when a text in a foreign language is transcripted to a\n        language that you know, you will only be able to read the word in the\n        source language without understanding its meaning. It only lets you\n        pronounce the word correctly in a foreign language.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Transliteration and transcription make the foreign language accessible\n        to those who are not aware of foreign alphabets. They focus on\n        pronunciation and do not convey meaning. This is used when you need to\n        discuss foreign places, people, or cultures.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>The Difference Between Transcription And Transliteration</h2>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Transcription</strong> – It converts characters of one\n          particular language to another as per the target language’s\n          pronunciation. The use of transcription is that everyone who speaks\n          the target language can read the word converted from the source\n          language correctly.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transliteration</strong> – Here, every character in the source\n          language gets assigned to a different and unique character used in the\n          target language. So this allows a one to one inversion. If there are\n          more characters in the source language as compared to the target\n          language, then the combination character can be used.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        Transliteration and transcription both are processes that convert text\n        from one to the other script. Transliteration, however, represents the\n        graphemes of the source script and transcription focuses on representing\n        the phonemes.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>Who Uses Transcription Services?</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Transcription is mostly used to convert oral files, video, and audio\n        into text format. Paralegals and law firms, healthcare providers, market\n        researchers, and video production firms make use of the transcription\n        services.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>When Is Transliteration Put To Use?</h2>",
        "<p>\n        When you read any international news, then it is transliteration that\n        lets you understand the context. This especially can be seen in the\n        reference section. Here the foreign language is transliterated to let\n        you understand the source of the news.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        They are also used in restaurant menus and libraries. In libraries,\n        transliteration allows the processing of textual data. When the user\n        searches for index content, it is transliteration that helps him find\n        the information. It is written in a different alphabet, and this gets\n        returned in the script of the user.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Transliteration is also used in keyboards with a particular script to\n        write the text in another script.\n      </p>",
        "<h2><strong>Can Transliteration Help A Brand?</strong></h2>",
        "<p>\n        Yes, it can. <strong>Transliteration</strong> plays a major role in\n        helping your brand put the best face forward to the global audience. The\n        way you localize your brand’s name plays a pivotal role when you enter\n        the global market. And to localize it well you need brand\n        transliteration services.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Brand <strong>transliteration</strong> is crucial. When companies\n        venture and expand into foreign markets, they target customers whose\n        primary language is different from the native language of the brand.\n        Localizing the name of the brand into the local language using the local\n        alphabets will let the customers accept the brand. It shows the brand’s\n        objectives and signals that you are approaching the customers with\n        warmth and seriousness.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Transliteration</strong> thus works to create a human perception\n        of your brand. It is also important for SEO in the international market.\n        Some countries make it mandatory for every foreign company to translate\n        its brand name, which is a legal requirement.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>\n<strong>Brand Transliteration Is Not As Simple As It Looks</strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Transliteration covers the words from one to the other script.\n        Transliteration tries to preserve the original sound of the phrase or\n        the word. It also targets to capture the spirit of the brand but not its\n        precise meaning.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Transliteration may sound to be simple, but it is not so.\n        Transliterating the name of a brand could create pitfalls if done wrong.\n        However, if done in the right way, it creates a wealth of opportunities.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        So what may go wrong with transliteration? Transliteration could result\n        in a meaningless name, and this makes it confusing to remember. In\n        certain cases, transliteration could also resemble an offensive or\n        negative word in the target language.\n      </p>",
        "<h2><strong>The Right Way To Do Transliteration</strong></h2>",
        "<p>\n<strong>Transliteration</strong> done right is much more than avoiding\n        any mishaps. If the brand name that is transliterated looks meaningless\n        and portrays a name that is just a clutter mix of syllables, this will\n        not harm your company, but it will not do anything good for your brand\n        either. A great way to do transliteration is to combine the similarity\n        to the brand name phonetically with a local connection that is evocative\n        and resonant.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>The key focus is:</strong></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n          On the characters that are written individually and are used in the\n          name that is transliterated\n        </li>\n<li>\n          The quality or the meaning that the transliterated word evokes when it\n          is represented along with the other characters\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Effective transliteration considers the need to create fluency in the\n          brand name even when there is a cultural difference.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<h2>Professional Transliteration Service Providers</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Here are the steps that a professional transliteration service provider\n        takes. They are educated well in the right way to transliterate the\n        brand name.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n          The first step is to investigate how the target market talks and\n          perceives your brand. This is done through the target market local\n          search engine like any local customer to know how your brand ranks in\n          the regional search engine.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          The professionals then visit the forums and blogs where your brand is\n          discussed.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          They then visit the retail websites in the market to understand how\n          the local resellers market your brand.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        All the above steps are carried out to get useful insights, and then the\n        professionals carry out the <strong>transliteration</strong> of your\n        brand name and your website content for the target market.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Your brand’s name is crucial, and this is the first impression that\n        consumers get of your business. Your brand name lets them relate to the\n        services and products you have to offer. The brand name is what is going\n        to be a mark of the relationship between you and your customers.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Getting your brand name transliteration done by an expert is important.\n        They do not just understand the right way to translate your brand name\n        so that it immediately connects with the global audience but also knows\n        how to make it optimized for SEO. They understand the nuances of how to\n        translate your brand name to become immediately relatable to a foreign\n        audience.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Hire experts to offer globalized solutions and to evaluate the vast\n        options for your brand.[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]Subtitle is an art where a video in a particular language is\n        translated into another language in a written text subtitle. Subtitling\n        cannot be done by a novice and should be done only by trained and\n        efficient linguists who ensure that the subtitling works efficiently.\n        It’s suggested to consult experts for accurate\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations.php\"><strong>Subtitle translation</strong></a>\n        services.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        A professional translator comprehends the complexities of the translated\n        content of different kinds. The subtitle translator has experience in\n        working on several genres and works hard to keep the translation sound\n        to ensure that it syncs with the video. They work to retain the meaning\n        of the original content in the subtitle. Today, numerous companies want\n        to penetrate the international market, increasing the demand for\n        subtitle translation online. It opens up a global clientele for your\n        brand.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>Importance of technical and linguistic accuracy in subtitling</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Subtitling is used for entertainment and business communications to\n        cater to a global marketplace. It thus has many benefits. It is used to\n        render a dialogue or a narration in a video. The translation could be in\n        the same language or a different language to the original language in\n        the audio. In both of the cases subtitling lets people who cannot hear\n        or understand the language to still get the message that the video\n        wishes to convey.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Subtitling may sound to be easy, but it needs a lot of expertise to get\n        it right. Subtitling done badly gets easily noticed and ends up damaging\n        the reputation of the brand.\n      </p>",
        "<p>Here are the steps involved in the subtitle translation process:</p>",
        "<h3>\n<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/transcription.php\"><strong>Transcription</strong></a>\n</h3>",
        "<p>\n        The first step in the subtitling process is to transcript the audio\n        script. This is done if there is no written version of the audio. The\n        transcriber listens to the audio and writes it down word by word. Once\n        this is done, the written matter is used to create the subtitle content.\n        If the video is to be used for another country, then it will be sent for\n        translation.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Translation or adaptation</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        The content in the translated subtitles is not a word-to-word\n        translation of the original audio script. Subtitle translators first\n        understand the topic and convey the meaning, content, and tone of the\n        original video into the language of the target country. Their task,\n        however, does not end here.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Subtitling needs to follow the country-specific restrictions of space\n        and time. It should support the audio and the image content, and this\n        needs to be done as per the original video. This is why translation\n        cannot be done as a one on one conversion of the original text.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The text content of the substile should not read unnaturally. It should\n        have the right punctuations, rules of speaking, and all the conventions\n        of the original language.\n      </p>",
        "<h3><strong>Spotting</strong></h3>",
        "<p>\n        The next step in the process of subtitling is spotting. The translator\n        here calculates the time when the subtitle will appear and will\n        disappear from the screen. This is to ensure that the subtitle stays\n        synchronized with the original audio. Varied features determine the\n        subtitle duration in the video like the change of scene or a short\n        change in the camera. A professional software is used in subtitling\n        where the video is accessed, and the captions are time-coded accurately.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The final result should be synchronized perfectly and should follow the\n        audio and the idea fluently so that the subtitle naturally becomes a\n        part of the viewing experience.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>Technical specifications of subtitle translation</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Subtitle translation cannot be done by everyone. It is a technical\n        process and can be done by companies that specialize in the translation\n        type and have the necessary tools to ensure that the clients’\n        requirements are met. If you’re looking for subtitle translation,\n        consider all the specifications beforehand.\n      </p>",
        "<p>The technical specifications could be:</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>The number of characters that need to be on the screen</li>\n<li>\n          The length of time for which the subtitle should stay on the screen\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Subtitles will usually have one or two lines. They may range from 35\n          to 43 characters. They could be aligned left or centered. In some\n          countries, the subtitles are also placed vertically. The professionals\n          know the requirements for each country, and they translate the\n          subtitles specific to the country.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          The subtitle should be shown at a pace that should not exceed 12\n          characters per second.\n        </li>\n<li>\n          Some subtitle translators have replaced characters with pixels that\n          allow proportional lettering to let the linguist write as much text as\n          he wishes to depend on the font’s size and the space on the screen.\n        </li>\n</ul>",

        "<h2>Why is subtitling the best choice</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Many solutions can be applied to your audio and video projects. Below\n        are some of the reasons why subtitle translation could be your preferred\n        option.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Cost and the turnaround time</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Cost and the turnaround time</h3>",
        "<p>\n        If you have a short timeline and a limited budget, then subtitles are a\n        better choice. It cuts on the cost of sound engineering, studio\n        recording, and editing post-production. The fees of the professional\n        voice-over actors are also not very high. Subtitling is quick as there\n        are fewer steps involved and thus need fewer professionals.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Makes your video better accessible</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Makes your video better accessible</h3>",
        "<p>\n        Many have hearing disabilities and subtitles make it easy for even those\n        with hearing loss to understand the video with ease. This makes your\n        video inclusive for many. People may wish to watch videos without sound,\n        and this is again where subtitles come into play. Some learn better by\n        listening, and others learn better by seeing things. The substiles help\n        to communicate the intended message without any communication gap.\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Everyone does not speak your language</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Everyone does not speak your language</h3>",

With over 7000 languages spoken across the world, subtitle\n        translation makes it easy to reach out to a wide clientele. Knowing\n        where your customers are located, and the language they speak can help\n        your brand connect with your audience faster.\n      </p>",

This is because of the huge\n        consumer base that the country has to offer. But in order to be\n        successful in this country, businesses have to localize. Adapting to the\n        local culture and language is an effective way of attracting regional\n        consumers who do not speak English.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The internet has allowed businesses to reach remote locations and tap\n        into newer markets. The quantity of regional content available on\n        digital platforms is far too less as compared to the size of the\n        audience that is looking for it. This can turn out to be an amazing\n        opportunity for businesses since there is tremendous potential for\n        growth and limited competition in the regional marketplace.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Brands that have localized their operations have seen significant growth\n        in viewership. This is because a significant portion of the population\n        does not speak English and look for content in their regional language.\n        Interacting in the native language allows users to be more comfortable\n        and trusting of the brand.

This is ever\n        more pertinent when a business is trying to expand to a foreign\n        marketplace. To be able to relay a clear and concise message to the\n        consumers, the business needs to hire a translation service.

If you are looking for\n        ways to form a strong foothold for your business in India, you need to\n        hire an expert translation service to help you reach the non-English\n        speaking consumer base. Some qualities that one needs to look for in the\n        translation service are:\n      </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Quality Service</strong>: This is the most important feature\n          that you need to look for. A service with quality work response has a\n          team of experienced professionals who can provide the best quality\n          translation for your content.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Versatility</strong>: You should always go with a service that\n          caters to multiple languages. This will ensure that you do not have to\n          look for different services for translating to different regional\n          languages.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Economic</strong>: The translation service should be\n          affordable. An AI translation service can help in cutting the\n          operation cost and making the process more economical.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Security</strong>: Privacy of data is another important\n          cause of concern for people looking for translation service. A\n          professional service maintains the integrity of the data and does not\n          allow any third party to access it.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Time-Bound Service</strong>: To keep up with the pace of the\n          marketplace, you need a translation agency that can provide the\n          translated content within the promised time.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specialization</strong>: Several sectors such as IT, legal,\n          healthcare etc. require the usage of precise terminology. This\n          requires you to hire a service that specializes in these sectors.\n        </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Proofreading</strong>: It is important that you choose a\n          service that provides a translation free of any errors. This could put\n          the reputation and credibility of your company at risk. This is why\n          the translated text has to undergo several rounds of proofreading to\n          ensure that it is free of any error or ambiguity.\n        </li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n        Accurate translation is essential for relaying the right message across.\n        The audience prefers viewing content in their language. By making this\n        possible, you can gain their trust and loyalty. The number of\n        non-English speakers outweighs the English speaking urban population.\n        This is why there has been a significant shift in brands’ focus\n        recently. A lot of businesses are altering their marketing campaigns to\n        appeal to this regional audience.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>In Conclusion</h2>",

To\n        appeal to native language speakers, businesses have to alter their\n        marketing strategy. The internet has a better reach than ever.

This is why you should hire a legal translator that is\n            capable of providing quick services. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Multilingual- the agency should have translators that are fluent in\n            English as well as the target language. Choose a company that\n            supports multiple languages and is well-versed with the vocabulary\n            and grammar of these languages. You cannot afford to have small\n            mistakes in such documents since the stakes are too\n            high. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Legal knowledge- Along with the expertise in the target language,\n            the translator also needs to be aware of the laws of the country\n            that you are targeting. This is important to avoid any ambiguity or\n            technical error in the translation, which can cause damage to you\n            later. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Range of services- A good translator specializes in translating\n            several types of documents. Go for a service that offers translation\n            for a variety of legal documents and can translate them\n            efficiently. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span> Necessary certificates- Make sure that you only hire a\n            service that has the required certificates and qualifications to be\n            able to perform this task. Always ask for credentials before hiring\n            the translator for your important legal documents.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Well-trained staff- The translators have to be very well-skilled.\n            They need to have an extensive vocabulary in both the languages, be\n            aware of the grammar and laws used in both the regions and have a\n            clear understanding of how the legal system works in your target\n            location. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Quality-checks- Another essential feature that is a hallmark of a\n            good translator is that they do various quality checks after the\n            translation to ensure that there is no error in the </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><b>document</b></a><span>. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>All of these qualities will help you find a service that is reliable\n          and committed. When you hire the best legal translation service, you\n          do not have to worry about the accuracy of your legal documents. They\n          have a team of well-skilled professionals who have expertise in the\n          native language and the legalities associated. They can provide you\n          language support for any overseas business transaction, court\n          interpretation etc. Choose a reliable service only after checking\n          their credentials. This will save you from any legal consequences in\n          the future. </span>[:]\n      </p>",

Often the\n          language of a region defines their cultural values and reflects their\n          practices. As a business which is planning to start a long term\n          relationship with these potential customers, you have to consider\n          their cultural practices and language as two important aspects of your\n          business with them. Say your business is located in the Delhi region.\n          You have to make use of a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com\"><b>translation company in Delhi NCR</b></a><span>\n          region to let your business speak your customer’s language. You must\n          be wondering how does the language play a role in\n          business? </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>Language is something which can connect people. It creates a sense of\n          belongingness and trust. Similarly, if your company approaches its\n          target audience in their language, there’s an initial building of\n          trust involved. </span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Language as a trust builder:</span><span>\n            Let’s be honest, no one likes change. A customer wouldn’t want to\n            change his/her regular grocery market for a newly opened\n            supermarket. The change will only take place if there’s a sense of\n            trust towards the brand and the quality of product or service. So\n            how do you build this trust? The key is communication. Now this\n            communication, when held in the customers’ native language says that\n            your business cares about their preferences. Thus it builds\n            trust.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Language leads to transparency</span><span>: If you communicate with your customers in a foreign language,\n            there are high chances of miscommunication. A small misunderstanding\n            can lead to customers questioning the authenticity of your company.\n            Thus if the communication is held in their native language, the\n            chances of some misunderstandings are reduced. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Language makes people feel at home</span><span>: A business needs to focus on making its customers satisfied and\n            comfortable. There’s no better way to satisfy your customers than to\n            speak to them in their language. It makes communication two way as\n            people feel secure to give their feedback too. These feedbacks\n            should be considered by the company and acted upon for increased\n            customer satisfaction and ultimately revenue.<br/>\n</span>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "<p>\n<span>The <strong>translation</strong> is just a part of localization\n          process. Localizing a website or an application means focusing on the\n          following aspects:</span>\n</p>",

The way it is spoken, or\n            some particular words change; every language has different dialects.\n            While translating the dialects of the language should be considered\n            to be more relatable to the customers. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Transactional elements</span><span>: While localizing the currency, payment methods and other\n            transaction related parts should be aligned in accordance with the\n            region. It makes customers’ experience on your website or\n            application more convenient. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Cultural nuances</span><span>: The <strong>translation</strong> and the localization should be\n            in such a way that it encompasses the unique cultural nuances of the\n            region. It allows the customers and the clients to feel at home. The\n            success is in the details of the translation. Essential festivals\n            and holidays should be accounted for by the company. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Contact details</span><span>: To build more trust and show the authenticity of the business,\n            you need to provide contact information in accordance to their\n            region. The office address or phone numbers of the region says you\n            are available in case of any unforeseen circumstances.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>If these above mentioned factors are considered by a </span><span><strong>translation</strong> company in Delhi NCR</span><span> region, you should consider taking their services. </span>\n</p>",

        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>The Documents: Your business not only works with new customers due\n            to expansion but also with new clients. To strike a business deal\n            with your clients and earn their trust, you need to translate the\n            documents involved in the business. A professional legal translator\n            should translate the legal documents like the contract between two\n            parties. Other documents, like the financial documents of the\n            company, should be translated by a translator with a strong\n            background in commerce. The brochures or manuals should be\n            translated for reaching out to both the customers and the\n            clients. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>The Website: The website should be translated into the native\n            language of the customers as it is one of the first levels of\n            interaction you have with the customers and the clients. A welcome\n            message in their native language on the website is likely to boost\n            your online conversions. Th ease in navigating through the website\n            becomes easy, and thus there’s an increase in customer\n            satisfaction. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>The Mobile application: It will be a huge mistake if you translate\n            your website but not your mobile application as most of the people\n            now own a smartphone. The localization and translation of your\n            mobile application increase its ranking in the play store. It makes\n            it more visible and searchable. Once more people get aware of your\n            application, there’s a growth in your customer base.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>The Multimedia: The advertisements, video ads, posters etc should\n            be translated for better reach to the customers. It makes them feel\n            the content was originally created for their consumption. Also, it\n            puts more information about your brand in a better way.<br/>\n</span>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Earlier, international\n          business meetings took place in the presence of a translator. But with\n          the world sitting at the edge of technological advancement, nearly\n          every business meeting is now limited to blank screens of laptops and\n          mobiles. In such a case, </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><b>document translation</b></a><span>\n          becomes instrumental for simplified business communication.

It’s the documents which facilitate\n          the transactions and lay down the policies, legal constraints,\n          products and services, etc for better two-way communication. If the\n          customer or client is confused as to what your business wants to\n          convey, it will have doubts to choose your brand and carry out future\n          business. Thus, it is imperative for the business to make its\n          documents available on a multilingual basis for better communication\n          and understanding. The conversions follow if the clients and the\n          customers can trust you and communicate with you freely. </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>The above mentioned documents are translated by full-fledged agencies\n          or independent linguists. It is recommended to choose an agency as it\n          has experts in every field.

You can get your regular translation done from him.\n          But, when it comes to a business, it requires professional translators\n          who can not only translate in a given language but also have a\n          background in contract law or corporate law. It allows the process of\n          transcribing easier. Transcribing is basically a term for legal\n          document translation. Since the judicial system is different in every\n          country, it becomes hard for the translator to find the equivalent of\n          a certain word in the target language. This requires understanding the\n          meaning of that legal term in the source document and later deciding\n          to present the meaning of that term in a simplified manner to the\n          readers, in this case, clients and customers.

To implement this\n          vision, the National Association of Software and Services Companies\n          (<strong>NASSCOM</strong>) hosted its\n          <strong>premier XperienceAI Virtual Summit in September 2020</strong>.\n          It is a four-day long summit aimed to put together more than\n          <strong>5000 global leaders, research organizations, leading practitioners,\n            entrepreneurs, and policy makers</strong>\n          from around the country to ponder on the\n          <strong>vital role of AI in business growth, revival, and economies</strong>. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Empathetic usage of AI in India can possibly modify social and\n          economic interactions for the better.

There were\n          <strong>deeptech</strong> workshops, conversations, and keynotes for\n          the summit to address key enablers and recognize specific\n          recommendations. The goal of the <strong>XperienceAI</strong> summit\n          was to bring together various\n          <strong>global and Indian entrepreneurs and leaders</strong>.

        "<p>\n        [:en]Language is very important in communication. Be it written\n        communication or oral communication, usage of the proper language\n        many-a-times could change the effect such communication can have on the\n        counter-party or the audience for whom the subject matter was designed.\n        The unbridled joy of listening or reading your local language is\n        inexplicable. It is a similar joy to meeting someone who speaks your\n        language in a foreign country and it obviously affects the perception of\n        the audience. This brings up a very important question, about the need\n        for content localization and whether it plays any role in how the\n        content is perceived by the target audience.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        It is very important to first understand the difference between\n        translation and localization. While translation is converting one\n        language into another local language, localization goes beyond that and\n        involves the inclusion of even cultural sensitivity, issues and ideas to\n        deliver content that connects to the feelings of the local audience that\n        is the target of the content. While translation is a tricky job, it is\n        not as complex and costly as localization, which would involve\n        understanding the culture and then recreating the content to deliver in\n        a manner that associates with the said culture.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Businesses today face various dilemmas with regard to content\n        translation and localization. These dilemmas include:\n      </p>",
        "<ol>\n<li>\n<strong><u><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\">Translation</a> or\n              <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\">localization</a>:<br/> </u></strong>\n</li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        The first question that an entrepreneur must answer is whether the\n        translation is needed or localization is the answer to the problem. It\n        is highly dependent on the product and content which is being\n        communicated and the market sensitivity to that product.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The cost-efficiency tradeoff between translation and localization should\n        be understood and probable numbers wherein differences amongst using\n        either of the strategies on cost, sales and market penetration should be\n        studied before making any final decision.\n      </p>",
        "<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<strong><u>Business Secrecy:</u></strong>\n</li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        A marketing campaign is often developed secretly in order to gain\n        surprise over its competitors. Campaigns are easily broken or diluted\n        today and hence many companies prefer an in-house team for marketing and\n        content creation. This ensures that there is minimal data leakage and\n        employees are under the constant eye of the management to avoid any such\n        incidents which could derail a careful planner endeavour. This becomes a\n        problem when it comes to the localization of content. While the\n        translation to an extent can be completed in-house by having language\n        experts, localization is a different game altogether. It includes a\n        deeper understanding of the culture, the local people, as well as key\n        issues that connect with them. It is not easy to find such a person in\n        an in-house team who can deliver efficiently. If localization has to be\n        effected, it might involve giving the responsibility of that particular\n        part of the campaign and content to an outside team. This puts at risk\n        the secrecy which could have been maintained by an in-house team as the\n        control over an outside team is not similar to control over one’s own\n        employees. While the expertise of a local is needed to develop effective\n        content and campaign, one must be wary of the secrecy risk that the same\n        poses.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        This is where an established service provider can prove invaluable.\n        Reputed providers of localization and\n        <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\">translation services</a> will have the\n        integrity to maintain the secrecy of your business campaign and do an\n        effective job as well.\n      </p>",

        "<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<strong><u>Target Audience vs Costs:<br/> </u></strong>\n</li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        A company or organization should indulge and study the costs involved in\n        a translation or localization project. This should be ideally compared\n        with the audience and market they are targeting. Whether they will be\n        enticed by such translation or localization and the costs involved to\n        get the project executed are parameters that are to be considered. If on\n        sample survey data it seems that the costs outweigh the benefits or the\n        company would barely be able to penetrate the market, then such a\n        project should be designed that will prove to be an effective campaign.\n        Planning plays a vital role in developing localized content that can\n        help achieve a breakthrough for the organization.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        These dilemmas should be considered by the enterprise before taking any\n        decision with regard to content translation or localization. Although\n        the costs may seem high to get such a project executed, such projects\n        are known to attract the customers and make them feel a part of the\n        company wherein such content has been created, curated and is being\n        distributed. Consumers often want to feel like they are a part of\n        something bigger and that the company cares for them. In such a\n        scenario, localized and translated content could result in brand loyalty\n        for multiple years for the concerned organization.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Translation and localization could have a profound effect on the\n        popularity of the content creator and give them a new market. Something\n        as simple as a few lines in a local language in a movie, usage of the\n        local cuisine or shots of the local market has not only attracted the\n        regular audience but created a whole new group of audience for such\n        content. Amitabh Bacchan being a part of Gujarat tourism campaign was\n        one such instance where local language, local background and\n        localization of the content created a positive furor amongst the target\n        audience. Similar campaigns have been employed by movies, advertisements\n        and even print media to take advantage of the emotive aspect of\n        consumers and generate greater audience reach.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>What are the issues that should be considered before engaging a\n          translation or localization activity?</strong>\n</p>",
        "<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid taking any political stand</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        Content should not take any stand or show leaning towards any political\n        party or issue. This can garner negative publicity for the content and\n        the company. In the long run, it can prove harmful.\n      </p>",
        "<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Content should not have a religious bias</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        Making fun of any religion or religious issue should be a huge no from\n        the content creator or translator.\n      </p>",
        "<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<strong>Sensitive issues should not be used as target campaigns</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        Content should not use local issues that are sensitive and might cause\n        disruption in the area as their content idea.\n      </p>",
        "<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Focus on a specific audience</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        Content should target a particular niche of a consumer which the company\n        would have in mind. Generic content can close the option of using\n        localization again and the audience might not find it as a wow factor\n        anymore.\n      </p>",
        "<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Usage of local backgrounds:</strong></li>\n</ol>",
        "<p>\n        Using local imagery, backdrops or famous places of the local people can\n        help provide instant connection to the target audience.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        There is enough evidence that translation and localization of content\n        does help. The company should compare and prepare a cost-benefit\n        analysis before embarking on such a campaign though and ideally look\n        into the following issues before finalizing the idea to create such\n        content.[:]\n      </p>",

There are many online tools and services available online\n          that guarantee to offer you the most reliable translation results, but\n          in reality, the translations that are done by these tools look robotic\n          and far beyond the reality. So employ professional translation\n          services and turn your business into a money magnet. Here we’re\n          enlisting a few benefits that a professional translator can provide to\n          you.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>If you wish to turn your business into a renowned brand, then you\n          need to ensure that you maintain smooth communication with your\n          foreign clients. Even one error in the message that you’re trying to\n          convey to them can break your association and can hamper the\n          reputation of your company. Remember, when you’re in the market for\n          the real business, there is no chance of error. The online translators\n          mostly struggle with words that have multiple meanings, and therefore\n          just in order to save a few bucks, you should never take their support\n          as they will never give correct results. Even if one word is\n          misspelled in the deal, then you can lose that deal, or you might have\n          to suffer a huge loss.  A professional translation service\n          provider, on the other hand, has experts who’re competent enough in\n          the language in which you wish to translate your document or data.\n          They also ensure that even one word is not misspelled or seems to have\n          a different meaning ensuring smooth communication with your clients.\n          The professional translation companies are equipped with strict\n          translating processes and specialized translators in a wide array of\n          fields. The freelance or independent translators do not have extensive\n          experience in the technicalities of translation, and hence there can\n          be a chance of any errors in the translated work that you get from\n          them.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>Many times you have an important document or a verdict to be\n          translated, but you don’t find any option handy enough to offer you\n          speedy translation services. If you resort to the online translation\n          tools to save time on translation, then you’ll get nothing more than a\n          document full of errors. The freelance translators, on the other hand,\n          are piled up with tons of translation jobs, and they refuse from\n          offering you translation services on the go. In this case, you can\n          choose a professional translation service provider that will not take\n          much time to translate the content catalog. And even when you require\n          the translation to be done by the professional in a limited time,\n          you’re guaranteed to get error-free and accurate translation work\n          only. A professional translation company uses a combination of\n          experienced translators and a standard translation memory software\n          that translates your document wit utmost accuracy within the shortest\n          period of time. A professional translator ensures on-time delivery of\n          the\n          <strong><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\">translated documents</a></strong>.\n        </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>If you’re planning to launch your products and services abroad or you\n          wish to get the translation of an important document, you can’t wait\n          for long. There is a set deadline within which you need that document\n          in your hand. The best thing about professional translation providers\n          is that they will always deliver the translations on time with maximum\n          accuracy. So you can plan rest you the things accordingly as you know\n          you’ll get your translated document on time. </span><span> </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<strong><span>The professionals spot the common mistranslations and elucidate\n            them</span></strong>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>When you resort to machine translation, then words and expressions\n          with multiple meanings can be a huge struggle. If the content that you\n          have got translated will seem awkward to your clients, then it will\n          also raise a question mark on the reputation of your company. And if\n          you’re launching your products or services in the foreign region, then\n          if your communication with your customers is not intact because you\n          are resorting to cheap translation services, then they will lose hope\n          in your services and products. You can even land into danger if the\n          legal texts or technical or medical terms are mistranslated. For\n          example, if you have created a manual for an electrical or medical\n          device, the caution section needs to be accurate; otherwise, someone\n          might get hurt. So it’s best to hire a professional translation\n          service provider who knows in which sense a word can be used and where\n          the use of that word should be restricted. If you choose a\n          professional translator having specialization in your industry, they\n          can provide high-quality service. After all, they’ve chosen to\n          specialize in a specific field and have immense experience in the kind\n          of text that you want. </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>Whenever you translate any important document, a deed, or a piece of\n          the important guideline, it needs to have a particular workflow and\n          order. For example, if you want a form to be translated in your\n          language, then you can’t experiment with the order of the form. For\n          example, you can’t place the address in place of the address’s name\n          and your telephone number in place of your signature. The tone and the\n          style of the language in which you’re translating the document should\n          be maintained at all times else it can totally disrupt the meaning of\n          the document. The in-house translators and freelancers struggle\n          immensely in offering the best translation services because they are\n          already overloaded with their previous work. So if you wish to have a\n          high quality and logical workflow of your\n          <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><strong>translation document</strong></a>, then you must choose the\n          <a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><strong>best translation service</strong></a>\n          providers that offer exceptional translation results.</span>[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branding\">Branding</a> is\n        one of the problematic aspects of any business. The company has to\n        convince and make the customer want to spend money on their products. It\n        is not enough that they need the product; they should also trust the\n        provider to want to purchase it. One of the easiest ways of creating\n        brand loyalty is emotionally connecting with the customer. Creating a\n        connection often becomes an issue in India, where each state has its own\n        culture and uniqueness. It isn’t straightforward, even for Indian\n        brands. For Multi-National Corporations who have built their entire\n        brand on uniformity and similar quality of service all over the globe,\n        it becomes harder. India is a diverse and complex market, but therein\n        lies its specialty. It provides a more extensive customer base. It also\n        offers various options to connect to your consumers. Some of how your\n        brand can win the Indian regional market are as follows:\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>1.Understanding the culture:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Indians are one of the most challenging but equally simple people to\n        please. It is an irony that it is true. The brands looking to establish\n        themselves in India, whether global or Indian, should respect the\n        culture of the area to which they are catering. It will help the\n        consumers connect with them. It will make them feel special that the\n        brand and the company have been thoughtful about the local culture and\n        issues relevant to that region.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Understanding the culture would include understanding their food tastes,\n        the local issues that they face, and, most importantly, matters they\n        consider important as a faction. Many market leaders have explored the\n        tactics of tapping into a group through their culture. But it is one of\n        the most challenging strategies to execute.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>2.Market Segmentation:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        India is rightly famous for its diversity and different ethnicities all\n        over the country. There is no single strategy that would apply to the\n        markets in every region. The companies need to respect the same. They\n        should permanently divide the market into different segments and make\n        campaigns for each of these separately. It will make each section feel\n        equally important about their value to the company. Many brands have\n        already tested this strategy and had great success with them.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>3.Respect the local preferences:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Every region has its own local choices and preferences when it comes to\n        products and brands they trust. But it would be hard to understand for\n        any other people as to why it is so. Brands must learn to respect that\n        choice. Global companies like McDonald’s, KFC, and Pizza Hut, etc. have\n        launched their brands here and eventually marketed the products as per\n        the needs of the local community. If the local community, for example,\n        has no taste for meat and is dominated by vegetarians, promoting\n        meat-based products there is not going to help an eatery. Instead, the\n        company should focus on and create new products for the market. These\n        could also be used in other markets where the customers are not very\n        fastidious.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>4.Pricing:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        The consumers in India are very price-conscious, and even a small change\n        in price can cause you to lose customers. Hence, it is of paramount\n        importance that the pricing strategy for the country and the regions is\n        thoroughly thought through. The pricing should be implemented\n        appropriately with the use of market surveys and market feeders to gauge\n        the reaction of people. Brand loyalty of Indians is limited to a select\n        few companies, and a new company will have to give their time to earn\n        such loyalty. Until then, pricing will be their ultimate king.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>5.Targeted Marketing:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Targeted marketing is similar to market segmentation. But instead of a\n        region, a group or class of people is focused on this type of marketing.\n        The aim should be to differentiate the people into various niches based\n        on their age group, preferences, career, life stages, and such\n        parameters. Then the products should be designed to seem attractive to a\n        particular age-group or niche. For example, a music player playing only\n        old songs is appealing for someone belonging to the age group of 60-80.\n        The product will find its customers in that group, and it should be\n        marketed accordingly. The campaigns can also be designed to make it an\n        ideal gifting option. It can attract other age-groups who would want to\n        gift such products to their parents or grandparents.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>6.Emotions:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Emotions make a tricky brand campaign. It is a high risk and high reward\n        strategy, but if implemented effectively, it can hurl your brand to the\n        top of the market. Emotional brand campaigns can be designed in the\n        simplest of ways by promoting the products and services in the local\n        language. This will help the brand to connect to all age groups in one\n        sweep.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>7.Festivals:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Brands can use festivals to reach out to the people and the. India is a\n        land of varied and frequent festivals. Festive sales happen very\n        frequently owing to the number of festivals that are celebrated\n        regularly in the country. Campaigns involving acceptable food in\n        Navratri, pure vegetarian food during religious festivals, Puja Mandals,\n        and ideas regarding worship are some of how a brand can connect to the\n        customers.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        In a price-conscious consumer base like the Indian regional markets,\n        discounting and disruption can create a huge customer base for the\n        company and strip the rivals immediately of their market share. It is a\n        very high-risk strategy, and only companies with cash to burn should\n        look to employ the same. A gain in market share, coupled with quality\n        beyond the pricing, will help them disrupt the existing market. It will\n        establish a new one wherein such pricing can be reset.\n      </p>",

        "<p><strong>9.Stories:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        Who does not love stories? Marketing and branding using short stories\n        that end in cliff hangers is a fascinating concept to adapt to the\n        market of young Indians. If the stories are coupled with an already\n        existing Indian idea, it could mean a masterstroke for the brand and the\n        company. Establishing why the product fits in the story and how the\n        people in the story are the same as the target audience could help in\n        brand promotion.\n      </p>",
        "<p><strong>10.Product Differentiation and usage:</strong></p>",
        "<p>\n        The product should be useful to the consumer. Multi-faceted products are\n        attractive to everyone. Adding a new feature or another free product on\n        purchase of one or supplying free samples through newspapers or society\n        meetings can get your brand a boost.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        One of the main factors to establish your brand in the Indian regional\n        market is acceptance of what the consumer wants. Instead of trying to\n        push what you want to sell, understand their requirements first. It will\n        establish brand loyalty and trust, which can become the platform to\n        launch further products. The existing consumer base will now be willing\n        to try out something from their trusted brand.[:]\n      </p>",

Hence, if people in those regions lookout\n          for apps, they will prefer those that are operating in their local\n          language. User interactions are the key to an app’s popularity.

Almost two decades later,\n          there are millions of apps available in the market today that have so\n          many features that your fingers will fall short counting! There are\n          apps that come with options to be translated in different languages\n          and there are translation apps that help other apps in changing the\n          language to a more localized version. They work like third party apps\n          for other apps that do not run this technology. Do these translation\n          apps work properly? While most of them do, a number of them are fake\n          apps that replace the actual meaning with something entirely\n          different.</span>\n</p>",

Also, it should have a\n          number of languages embedded in it to ensure that your local language\n          exists. It is also necessary to check whether the service has been\n          released by a genuine company. Always look out for reviews to\n          understand the sincerity of service.  </span><span>While we are on this subject, let us guide you through the list of\n          reasons required for you to translate your apps at the earliest,</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Economic Prosperity</b><b>:</b><span>\n          Which countries in the world boast of an increase in economic growth\n          through their technology and inventions? Now, if those countries\n          manufacture apps in their language, their economic prosperity will\n          soar up. If you develop an application that does not work in their\n          language, your reach economically would get hampered. English is\n          understood in most parts of the world. Other languages like Russian,\n          Hindi, Chinese, and Urdu are also equally important and your app\n          should have options for translation to ensure that it reaches maximum\n          users in a short span of time.</span><span></span>\n</p>",

When\n          clients visit your site and can read the website in their\n          mother-tongue, they will be able to grasp its content effortlessly. It\n          will be easier for them to locate their target. This will encourage\n          them to interact with your site further, which is key to consumer\n          conversion. When you reach out to potential customers in their local\n          language, they acquire a better customer experience, and you gain\n          their trust instantly.</span>\n</p>",

SEO helps\n          in bringing an increased number of visitors to your website. How can a\n          proficient translator help enhance your search engine result? A\n          well-optimized SEO-friendly site should contain the keyword, Meta\n          titles, alt tag, and Meta descriptions. These are the features of\n          Google algorithms that help in deciding the rank of your website in\n          the search engine results.

The surprising findings of a survey conducted\n          by Common Sense Advisory are that native language is preferred by 55%\n          of website users for online shopping, and 60% of internet users rarely\n          buy at websites that are written only in English. A whopping 74% of\n          customers will go back and make a second purchase when they receive\n          customer support in their native language. Hence, to increase\n          conversion ratio, do give serious thought to translating your\n          website.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>Translation</span></a><span>, over the years, has incredibly changed the dimensions of the\n          business in every field and added value to it. The companies today do\n          not limit themselves to a particular region, state or nation. Still,\n          talks of expanding it beyond the borders, and this confidence is a\n          blessing of the existing assistance from various translation services.\n          Today, if any company want to have a new set of the audience even from\n          an unfamiliar country, the agencies like the legal translation and </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><span>document translation</span></a>\n<span>become of utmost importance.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>No doubt, the ease to convert the content in a language into the\n          targeted language has a substantial considerable role to play in the\n          expansion of the business. However, several other factors compel\n          people to go for a document translation agency. Have a look at the top\n          ten of them:</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Consistency and accuracy-</b><span>\n          It is essential to translate any document for the business because\n          there have to be some keywords including the terminology, product\n          specifications, abbreviation, etc. in the familiar\n          language. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Now you might think that anybody who knows the languages can perform\n          the translation; it may be a friend of yours. But, can everyone attain\n          a similar level of accuracy as the professionals do? Absolutely no!\n          You need to have an esteemed </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/online-document-translation/\"><span>document translation</span></a>\n<span>agency with some required set of skills and expertise to provide the\n          document with authenticity and originality. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>A long-term investment</b><span>– Whenever you plan to spend some amount in translation, you must\n          consider it as an investment. This is because an excellent translation\n          means a proper understanding of the document. Once your targeted\n          officials and customers have understood the papers, there are\n          increased chances of success. And in that case, you can expect an\n          improved </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment\"><span>ROI</span></a><span> in the business.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Reduced turnaround times-</b><span>\n          Translation services are not a one-time thing. You may need to get to\n          them again and again for similar and varied documents. But, when you\n          have a professional translator by your side, this turnaround time is\n          reduced to a considerable extent. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Better than online translation-</b><span>\n          Online document translation seems to be a feasible option for many.\n          Though it can be used anywhere and is cheaper, it does not promise\n          accuracy. Moreover, there are several complicated words which only a\n          proficient speaker can understand. So, relying solely on online\n          translation websites and apps can be problematic for the\n          business.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Requirement in the country- </b><span>The need for professional document translation can be felt in the\n          areas where the laws of target country have made it mandatory.\n          Generally speaking,</span>\n<span>the</span>\n<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\"><span>legal translation</span></a>\n<span>needs to be certified by a professional.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Protects from malpractice- </b><span>The documents, especially the legal ones need to be error-free as the\n          minute error in the wordings can change the entire meaning, which can\n          make you responsible for the malpractices. But, when you hire the\n          professionals for the work, you reduce such chances of error to the\n          minimum.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Personal assistance-</b><span>\n          The requirement of document translation agencies is not felt for the\n          business, but can also be utilised for your understanding of the\n          products and services. This keeps you at the safe side of having some\n          reliable source for the better translation of the foreign papers or\n          documents.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Complex terminology- </b><span>The substitution for some words in the foreign language are hard to\n          find.

        "<p>\n<b>Free of worries- </b><span>Translation, at times, can become a big challenge. It fills you with\n          uncertainty, especially when you are not sure of the quality you will\n          get from the preferred agency. In such cases, going for a\n          well-established reputed agency seems to be the most feasible option.\n          It guarantees you an error-free time delivered document.</span>\n</p>",

So, document translation becomes a significant element of\n          the arrangement one needs to make to expand the trade. In that case,\n          hiring a trustworthy document translation agency keeps you at safe\n          hands and also provides you with moral support.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>So, the reasons mentioned above are enough to give a clear idea of\n          why people today are loving the document translation services. In\n          simple terms, these translation services ate not providing the\n          necessary technical assistance but also helping them morally to\n          withstand the challenges and work diligently towards the goal.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Finally, you need to understand that no matter what the field is, you\n          must ensure that the translator is well qualified to take your work in\n          hand. If they are not, do not proceed at any cost and look for the\n          better and deserving ones.</span>[:]\n      </p>",

This\n          effort to localise can be a business booster too. By localizing your\n          brands and the marketing campaigns, you are bridging the gap between\n          you and the target audience. With this one step, you are making the\n          smooth path for the trade in the target land.\n        </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Many a time, the terms localize and translate are used\n          interchangeably, but it is not so. Localisation is not limited to\n          changing the language of the words but much beyond. It deals with all\n          the efforts to familiarise the marketing campaign with the culture and\n          tradition of the new target audience. The expert professionals in </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><span>website localization</span></a>\n<span>companies, thus, assist in making your brand a memorable name for the\n          audience. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>What is website localization?</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>When you are well versed with the fact that your audience hails from\n          different parts of the world, a website in a common language is not\n          enough. There would be many who would only prefer their native\n          language to look for the products. Then the necessity to modify the\n          website would arise, and that very process is termed as website </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\"><span>localization</span></a><span>. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Website localisation is a multi-step procedure. It involves a\n          complete team of skilled professionals who work hard to make the\n          website relevant, understandable, appealing and engaging. Therefore,\n          you got to have the best </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/why-is-website-localization-services-considered-underrated/\"><span>website localization</span></a><span> agency at work and ensure a high quality of work.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Why is every business compelled to use website localisation?</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>In the world which is transforming every other moment, you have to\n          pour all your creativity to retain the customers and altogether\n          prepare a new string. Website localisation thus becomes another\n          powerful tool to do this, and that is why all kinds of business today\n          are seeking useful services.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Have a look at some authentic reasons for the same:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Expansion of the market</b><span>–</span><span>\n          If you aspire to rule the heart and minds of your local customers, you\n          need to adapt yourself to their language and culture. You will even\n          need to understand their perspective and the way they see things. To\n          break such linguistic and cultural barriers, you need a person well\n          versed with this target language and tradition.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Though many factors affect market penetration like the price, quality\n          of the product, etc. however, the way you present your products and\n          services also has a substantial impact. So, </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/professionals-of-website-localization-services-and-their-best-practises/\"><span>website localization</span></a><span>\n          help to blend the brand well in the new market and thus facilitate\n          market expansion.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Growth in sales-</b><span>\n          One obvious thing is the more the reach, the more will be the chances\n          of the growth in sales. On Customising the site as per the new target\n          audience, you succeed in increasing the reach and engage them for a\n          longer time. This, in turn, will increase the traffic and improve\n          sales.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Information is the first step</b><span>– Every consumer today do an in-depth analysis of the company before\n          interacting with them directly. Now, until and unless they can\n          understand the content, they cannot proceed to purchase the product.\n          In that case, making the information available to them become your\n          prime duty. This is also essential to keep them updated about the\n          launch of any new product and being interactive with them. An\n          effective </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/expand-your-business-globally-with-reliable-website-localization-services/\"><span>website localization</span></a><span> process fulfils this demand.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Customer satisfaction-</b><span>\n          Localization is not merely the change of a few wording but is the\n          process of inclusion. Through this very process of website\n          localisation, you showcase your concern for the customers and their\n          satisfaction. In the long term, this satisfaction helps to keep you in\n          the good books of the customers and pave the way for a loyal\n          customer-business relationship.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Risk reduction- </b><span>Many countries have a special significance of a few colours and\n          symbols. If you do not use website localisation, you would never\n          research for their culture, and thus never know that. This, in turn,\n          may put you in the risk of misunderstandings with the target\n          customers.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Localization act as a precaution and thus save you from such\n          unnecessary culture conflicts.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Are you still thinking?</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Localization has proven to be a worthy investment for various\n          businesses so far, and many new small businesses are looking forward\n          to it. So, if you plan to go global, any other tool cannot substitute\n          website localisation in terms of the benefits it offers.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Also, in a country like India, where you will find various dialects\n          prevalent, the significance of </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><span>Indian language translation</span></a><span>\n          cannot be ignored. Here, the translation agencies with skilled and\n          proficient translators are proving to be the game-changer for every\n          business.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Hence, website localization and translation play a vital role in the\n          diversifying business world today. However, you always need to be\n          careful during the selection of the agency. Keep in kind that the\n          calibre of the people at work will decide the effectiveness of the\n          results.</span>\n</p>",

Communication that is the basis of\n          connection is getting easier and is paving the way for the smooth\n          business deals and other projects. Without a doubt, the translation\n          services of any kind have become a must-avail service for the\n          entities.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<b>Law needs it</b><span>– It may be annoying but is mandatory in many cases. Multiple courts,\n          financial institutions, and others demand a translated official\n          document from the other country and that too notarised by a licensed\n          professional. But don’t worry! An established language service company\n          takes care of all this. </span>\n</p>",

Some extra\n          efforts from your end may include checking the accuracy,\n          certification, and quality of the</span>\n<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/how-to-have-a-fantastic-legal-translation-with-minimal-spending/\"><span>legal translation</span></a><span> services of the preferred company.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>To avoid unwanted surprises</b><span>– Legal documents are always prepared to serve your interests and\n          safeguard your rights. In that case, having a professional translator\n          for them will relieve you of any further worries you may have to face.\n          Any nasty surprise will not then creep into your way, and thus the\n          document will meet the objective rightfully.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Machine translation is not enough</b><span>– The idea of translating the legal documents by one of your\n          bilingual buddies would have surely come to your mind. Are you still\n          thinking it’s a better idea? Only a beginner can figure upon this as\n          the practitioner will indeed know the complexity of the legal\n          documents and the complications with the terminologies used in it.\n          Even google translators are not competent enough to perform this. It\n          may give you a word-to-word </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span> but the accuracy, it will never promise. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>The slightest error can cost a lot</b><span>– Legal documents are framed with equal attention to each and every\n          clause mentioned in it, and every word has some meaning. Any error,\n          therefore, can cause much harm to you and bring drastic changes in the\n          final use of the document.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>To prevent the loss of time and money</b><span>– Suppose you have a loan agreement or employment contract and\n          unfortunately you had some glitch in the translation. Not only will\n          the loan be delayed, but it will leave you with regret of having it\n          done casually. That is why it’s better to hire a professional\n          legal</span>\n<a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\"><span>translator</span></a><span> in the first attempt. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>For the support and confidence</b><span>– On handling everything on your own may leave you stressed and lost,\n          especially on facing avoidance by bureaucrats in the foreign country.\n          Whereas, having a professional on your side will make you confident\n          and assured for the success of your work.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>For the expertise and specialisation</b><span>– Whenever you attempt to translate technical documents, it’s\n          essential to use the relevant terms to make it meaningful and useful.\n          The experts in the field are accustomed to this and gain the\n          vocabulary naturally with practice. For the flow of your legal\n          documents, expert translators are a must.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>For the effectiveness</b><span>-The need for translation services will vary from business to\n          business, increasing with the size. Well, no matter what is the\n          requirement, an efficient translation will always add to the value and\n          effectiveness of management. So, the more you invest in your</span>\n<a href=\"https://devnagri.com/why-and-how-to-choose-professionals-for-official-legal-translation-services/\"><span>legal translation</span></a><span> services, the more you actually save.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Unprecedented growth</b><span>– At last, the right legal translation services help you adhere to\n          the law, especially when you are planning to expand to the foreign\n          lands. This way, these professionals become a partner in the growth of\n          your business.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Well, the merits of hiring the best translation services are\n          innumerable, but the points mentioned above can work as the guiding\n          light. The crux of all the information, therefore is that whether it\n          is the legal translation or the </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><span>document translation services</span></a><span>, you should always prefer the professionals. Relying on a bilingual\n          buddy or the machine alone can lead to a loss in various forms,\n          including the monetary.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There are multiple methods to initiate your search for the right team\n          for your work. However, one simple technique can be to ask your\n          friends or colleagues about the trusted agency, which they might have\n          used earlier and then continue the deal.</span>[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n<span>The most crucial takeaway in such an expansion is the\n          understandability of your online content.

The various </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><span>mobile app translation</span></a><span>\n          service companies make you familiar with the process and help you have\n          a fair boost in the organic traffic.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Why translation for mobile applications?</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>With the changing times and the advancing generations, the use of\n          mobile applications has paced up. This very factor has increased the\n          importance of mobile apps and their translations in multiple\n          folds.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>When you hear the term mobile app translation, you need to understand\n          that it is the process of changing the language of the mobile\n          application as per the comfort and understanding of the new target\n          audience. This one change will bring a lot of benefits to the business\n          and facilitate the growth and expansion for sure. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The various ways to this facilitation through</span>\n<span>mobile app translation are:</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Easy accessibility to the audience</b><span>– When your mobile application is multilingual, it will be easily\n          found on the app stores and will be used by more number of\n          people.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Branding and publicising</b><span>– Once the user downloads the application, the friendly logo and\n          symbol will be displayed on the mobile screen, which becomes a virtual\n          reminder about your company. So, it does a lot for spreading awareness\n          regarding your company to others.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Building trust and credibility</b><span>– Every business seeks the confidence of the customers desperately.\n          Building the mobile application in the native language of the target\n          customers helps to create the connection and required faith. Also,\n          when the users find you working hard to enhance their accessibility by\n          translating the mobile app, they keep you in the top priority. This\n          way, you get an edge over the other competitors.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>User satisfaction</b><span>– An efficient mobile app translation in the native language enhances\n          the user experience and improves the two-way interaction. The audience\n          stays updated with your new launches and shares with you the valuable\n          feedback, facilitating the improvements and enhancements.</span>\n</p>",

However, this alone cannot do all good for the growth.\n          Whenever any company widens its target audience, it needs to prepare\n          the content according to the taste of the new users, so that they can\n          connect to it easily. Nonetheless, not only the language but the\n          culture and interests have to be considered during the process.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>So, when all the aspects are considered, and the website and other\n          platforms are made friendly for the new target audience, it is termed\n          as localisation.

It is pivotal to incorporate this technique if you\n          wish to expand your product to new markets. Adapting to the audience’s\n          culture and language can play a significant role in appealing to\n          them.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>This type of translation is important for making your video content\n          easy to understand and more appealing to the multilingual audience. </span><b>Voice over translation</b><span>\n          helps gain the trust of potential buyers by promoting your products in\n          their own language. It is more likely for users to avail products and\n          services when they are promoted in their own language. This may\n          involve voice replacement or off screen voice over. This approach can\n          be used for translating e-learning material, commercials, animation,\n          films, presentations, documentaries and videogames.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>NEED FOR VOICE OVER TRANSLATION:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Voice over translation</span>\n<span>isn’t just replacing the words but also delivering the right accent,\n          diction and tone. It can be instrumental in gaining more audience and\n          appealing to new markets. The process involves translating the\n          original script to the required language and choosing the right voice\n          actor and recording the audio. This provides authenticity to your\n          content and helps connect better with the viewers.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p><b>ADVANTAGES OVER SUBTITLING</b><b>:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Depending on the subtitles to understand the language of the video\n          can be troublesome. It is hard to keep up with the speed of the\n          subtitles. Most viewers end up missing significant parts of the visual\n          actions unintentionally. Other important background details and body\n          language of the speaker is also hard to read when focusing on reading\n          the subtitles. Having the audio translated rather than providing\n          subtitles for the video is thus preferable. Translating the e-learning\n          modules makes it easier for the viewers to understand the concept\n          easily as the tone/mood cannot be conveyed through subtitles.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Moreover, subtitles take up a considerable amount of space on the\n          screen and may become distracting. They can be extremely confusing\n          when multiple speakers are present. There is more chance of the user\n          retaining the information on hearing it than reading the words on the\n          screen. The length of the subtitles may not match with the original\n          language leading to crowding of the screen. It is essential that the\n          speed of the subtitles sync with that of the visual action for the\n          user to follow the content.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>ADVANTAGES OVER TRANSCRIPTING</b><b>:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Having the audio translated is far better than providing a written\n          transcript of the video. This is critical for ensuring the clarity and\n          understanding on the part of the users. A written transcript may leave\n          the viewer guessing or assuming the most part of the content as there\n          cannot understand the visual cues to help them relate to the video. It\n          can be tedious to read and listen to two separate languages at the\n          same time.  It is impossible to infer the tone or mood of the\n          video from a written transcript. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>TYPES: </b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Many techniques are available for </span>voice over\n        translation<span>, namely:</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>UN style translation- This technique is most incorporated in\n            interviews, documentaries, speeches etc. The original voice is\n            played in a feeble volume in the background and the translated\n            version is played over that. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Dubbing- Dubbing involves directly replacing the original audio\n            while maintaining its tone. It also includes lip syncing and\n            enactment of every action that is happening in the video.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Instructional style: In this approach, a voice actor interprets the\n            video in the desired language. It provides more freedom to the\n            performer as no script is required for this type of\n            translation.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Dialogue replacement- This involves completely changing all the\n            original speakers’ dialogues by replacing them with different actors\n            for each role.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "<p><b>CHALLENGES:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Certain challenges that might come up during this translation:</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Understanding the cultural nuances of the targeted audience and\n            being able to portray them</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Not losing the original tone and message of the video. The tone is\n            as crucial as the words of the speaker</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Having a properly localized translation of the script that takes\n            into account the interests and likes of the multilingual\n            audience</span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>The main aim of voice over translation is to make sure that message\n          from the translated version aligns with the intent of the original\n          video.

        "<p>\n<b>Boost traffic-</b><span>\n          when you cross the geographical barrier and introduce your products\n          and services to the entire world through a multilingual website, the\n          chances of it getting noticed by more people increase manifold.\n          Reaching a market that is beyond your borders can help you engage with\n          and appeal to a more diverse set of audience.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Increased revenue-</b><span>\n          when the traffic to a website increases, the revenue generation is\n          automatically scaled up.  Users trust websites that are in their\n          language and are more likely to purchase from them.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Navigating market-</b><span>\n          doing business in a new territory can be challenging. Localizing the\n          website can help companies to get an idea of how their product does in\n          the international market.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Better user experience-</b><span>\n          providing an enhanced experience to the users helps them connect and\n          interact more with the brand. Language can be an asset in your\n          marketing strategy since the webpage is where most people get a first\n          impression of the product from.

Everything should be translated to ensure your customers\n          acquire an immersive in-language user or customer\n          experience. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There are various degrees of translation, including </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\"><span>localization</span></a><span>, conventional translation, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcreation\"><span>transcreation</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration\"><span>transliteration</span></a><span>.

        "<p>\n<span>Not all translation companies are born equal, so don’t plumb onto the\n          very first company that pops up on the search result. Take your time\n          and make the right decision as you wouldn’t want to pay for something\n          you’re not satisfied with. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>How to Select the Best Website Translation Agency?</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Website translation has become quite popular in merely a few years.\n          It is partially because of the fact that a lot of people and companies\n          are being interested in getting closer to a global audience and\n          partially because website translation services are increasing the\n          quality and reach of a website. However, finding the perfect company\n          is essential to reach your desired goal. So, what should you consider\n          before selecting a translation agency? </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Quality</b><b>: </b><span>Using great linguists is one thing, but if you want to ensure you’re\n          guaranteed a perfect translation every time, you should employ an\n          agency that has firm quality control processes in place. It will be a\n          rare case to see mistakes made by linguists employed by a reputed\n          translation agency. So, only hire an agency that fulfills whatever\n          claims they make and proofread the content before delivering it to\n          you. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Translators</b><b>: </b><span>Being able to speak a particular language doesn’t guarantee that a\n          person can be a good </span><a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\"><span>translator</span></a><span>. This is why you should consult an agency that only utilizes\n          well-qualified and certified mother-tongue linguists with complete\n          knowledge of your target dialect. Ensure that the chosen website\n          translation agency has a proven track record of not failing to meet\n          deadlines. Also, check if the company has experience of working in\n          your business field, especially when you work in a specialized\n          industry. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Services</b><b>: </b><span>Select a translation agency that offers you a single point of contact\n          who will always be available to discuss your requirements throughout\n          the translation process. Don’t connect with companies that just want\n          your raw content and provide a translated version without ongoing\n          discussion.

        "<p>\n<b>Testimonials</b><b>: </b><span>If you’re not familiar with the target language you want your website\n          content translated into, you’re likely to struggle to evaluate a\n          translation agency’s work by viewing previous examples of contents\n          it’s created for other clients. Don’t just come to a decision based on\n          testimonials available on its website, seek out an agency that\n          provides detailed feedback, references, and case students on\n          request. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Price</b><b>: </b><span>After choosing a certain agency, you will be getting translation\n          services that you’d be paying a certain amount, but it doesn’t mean\n          you should shell out more than your requirement. Look for an agency\n          that is willing to price-match its competitors, even if they are among\n          the top tier names in the industry. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Benefits of Getting Website Translation</b><span> </span></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There is no one universal language that is used in the world. It\n          inevitably means that there are a few markets you can’t reach with a\n          single-language centric website. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Imagine you have a strong customer-base outside of the country you’re\n          based in, and the majority of them are not familiar with the language\n          you’re website is available in. Wouldn’t it be better to have your\n          website available in various languages to make the customer reach easy\n          and address them in their own language? Keep in mind your local\n          customers are merely the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Get your\n          website translated and grow your business beyond your\n          borders.  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Be optimistic about your business’ potential for expansion and\n          demand. Going multilingual is an excellent way to trigger further\n          growth without involving in head-to-head competition. Break the\n          language barrier and reach potential customers who speak different\n          languages. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>So, what are you waiting for?

        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>As per the 2020 census, about 30,290,936 individuals cover the\n          population of Delhi National Capital Region. Expected to be the most\n          populous city of India, Delhi NCR is growing economically. With\n          booming corporate sectors and various educational institutions, the\n          scope for communication and language services is improving a\n          lot. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Following which, the translation industry is the backbone of the\n          city’s growth and development. So, hiring a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><span>translation company in Delhi NCR</span></a><span>\n          has turned into a routine on today’s date. From pursuing academic\n          goals to reaching business milestones, a majority of the Delhiwalas\n          opt for translation services to meet their needs and deeds. So, let’s\n          see a few features and the benefits of hiring a translation service\n          provider in Delhi. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>A Short Gist on India and its Translation Demands</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>We Indians dominate in Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,\n          Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, and a few more languages. Even authorities\n          and officials have concerns about estimating the accurate number of\n          language-dialects spoken totally in India. Living in a country where\n          people have 122 to 454 languages, translation plays a lead role\n          here! </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Though we are a culturally-deemed nation, our heritage and ethnicity\n          have an open space for accepting Western values too. Indians still\n          embrace the idea of globalization and industrialization, evident in\n          the form of international business, import and export services, and\n          even with different boards of education. These developments eventually\n          lead to the requirement for a localization and translation\n          service. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>It is not possible to expect a person to be completely fluent in both\n          Hindi and Tamil or Marathi and Gujarati. For this language void,\n          translation is the bridge to comprehension. Narrowing this context to\n          the reference of Delhi NCR, the following are the actual benefits of\n          hiring a </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span> company. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Top 4 Benefits of Doing a Translation in Delhi NCR</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The given below perks are not restricted to Delhi NCR but applies to\n          India as a whole.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Business Perspective: </b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There are 25+ business and manufacturing sectors in India. Which\n          means, a brand to get new consumers and expand the operation must\n          translate its goods and services. This way, besides Delhiwalas, more\n          people can understand your language, thus enabling new consumers or\n          users for your business. Moreover, a business needs to expand its\n          sources and verticals as revenue develops. Again, translation is the\n          solution and it helps international consumers prefer your business\n          over others right from Delhi NCR. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Online Marketing: </b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Search Engine Optimization (</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\"><span>SEO</span></a><span>) is an unarguable strategy to rank on search result pages and\n          convert users into customers, followers, or readers. Every\n          professional setup in Delhi needs a decent website, a fast-loading\n          app, and a responsive web page to interact with their users. When the\n          contents of your site are present in only 1 language, then you can\n          attract users only from that lingual. But when you perform a web page\n          or a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><span>mobile app translation</span></a><span>\n          in another language, then your contents are readable by several\n          cultures and indigenous people. Thus, it is going to help you rank\n          higher on servers, leading to better conversions. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Educational Intentions:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Students from and to Delhi require a translation service provider to\n          get their certificates, school/college records, and other research\n          journals language changed. The advantage here is that the candidate\n          will adhere to the norms of the joining university, as well as avoid\n          legal issues concerning language compliance. Apart from the stated,\n          school students outside Delhi, hire a translation agency to get their\n          documents translated in Hindi, English, or any, to join their desired\n          NCR-university.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Travel and Tourism:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>It is an obvious fact that Delhi is one of the beautiful places to\n          visit when it comes to Indian travel and tourism. From Qutub Minar to\n          the Taj Mahal, Delhi has numerous must-visit places. So, the travel\n          industry is an ever-increasing sector of India. A person, to visit\n          India (from India or outside) needs proper guides, instruction\n          booklets, and understandable route books to navigate their journey on\n          the safe path. For this, the language of the travel guides must be\n          understandable by the tourist, hence tapping the need for a\n          translation. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Note that the benefit of choosing a travel-related translation\n          company in Delhi NCR not only helps with comprehension but also pushes\n          the tourism sector of India, thus welcoming new migrants to India or\n          Delhi!</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Final Thoughts on the Translation Service in Delhi NCR</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>We know how translation helps in cultural understanding and better\n          knowledge of things around us. However, as technology is rapidly\n          growing, Indian citizens tend to use a software or mobile app\n          translation to get the requirements done fast. But the huge\n          disadvantage here is with the quality and accuracy of the results.\n          Machines still need time to develop appropriately. The ideal option\n          for a translation is hence by hiring a manual language expert in and\n          around Delhi NCR. </span>[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>Immigrants, foreign scholars, and professional clients looking for\n          international opportunities need a legal or official translation. By\n          having your file formats translated, you make sure that the official\n          papers abide by the laws of your nation. However, performing a\n          translation service for a legal document is quite challenging.\n          Experienced </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics\"><span>linguists</span></a><span>\n          yet achieve top-notch quality and high accuracy in the\n          results. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Saying that to get a quality-controlled translation of your\n          documents, you must be ready to pay some bucks. Your budget is a\n          common constraint to translate, especially when it comes to legal and\n          official language requirements. Not to ponder, as the following\n          information covers a few vital points on how to have a fantastic </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\"><span>legal translation</span></a><span> with minimal spending. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Tips to Cut-Down Expense on Translating Legal Files</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Here are the five chief tips to receive top-notch legal/official\n          translations on-hand. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Customization Costs:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span></span><span>Customization or personalization is the step where the customer or\n          client has the freedom to design and format their document, post the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span>\n          project. Since your translation is a legal requirement, you should\n          think twice before suggesting custom formats for your document. Why\n          because legal files have a specific type of font, context, layout,\n          etc. that are normed and governed by the laws. So, personal\n          suggestions and feedback recommendations are unwelcomed here. Doing so\n          can even lead to legal non-compliance issues. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Hence, do customization only if the project genuinely needs. This\n          way, you are translating the document as per the norms, and also\n          cutting-down the extra cost on document personalization charges!</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Re-Translation Expenses:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Consider this case – You hired an attractive-looking </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><span>document translation agency</span></a><span>\n          from an online server. The project gets completed well on-time. But\n          you notice that the accuracy is low in the translated version. Now,\n          you will question the skill of that respective translator and demand\n          him or her to do it correctly once again. The linguist, to\n          re-translate the document needs cash, so you pay once more. The total\n          cost of legal translation is thus doubled due to the re-translation\n          procedures. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Also read</b><span> : </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translation-service/\"><span>Legal Translation Service- The necessity to expand your global\n            outreach – Devnagri</span></a>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>As you might have noticed, errors are a notable concern with many\n          translation companies. Pay only once and the translator should give\n          excellent results without the need for repetitions. For this, hire\n          brands that promise 98% above accuracy and have quality-controlled\n          systems. Hiring experienced agents will have no room for errors!</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Target Language:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The demand for a Chinese, English, Japanese, French, Russian,\n          etc.</span>\n<span>legal translation service is rising as days pass. On the other side,\n          languages such as Dari, Navajo, Ashanti, Ho, Malay, are quite\n          unusually requested for translating a legal document. So, the point\n          here is, the cost of paying your translator increases with the rarity\n          of the target language. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Thus, ensure that your target language is a common one, to limit\n          spending on the language side. However, there might be a chance where\n          you need to get a legal document translated to a rare language. For\n          such conditions, you can get a rough idea (approximate value) on the\n          total cost of translation by getting a free quote. A free quote is\n          received by filling the details of your project, including its target\n          language, expected turnaround time (TAT), etc. Overall, your target\n          language plays an influential factor in charging the total payment of\n          a translation project.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Bulk Ordering:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>When it comes to translating legal certificates for academic and\n          business intentions, you might have more than three file formats.\n          Unreputable companies and inexperienced translators will charge money\n          for each project; this is going to increase your total translation\n          cost. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>By hiring professional linguists and brands with years of experience\n          on-field, the company may charge the total price of the legal language\n          project, based on the parameters of documents (type, format, TAT,\n          etc.) and not on individual projects. Moreover, expert translators\n          will give a discount and coupon code for bulk order services. Hence,\n          hire reputed service providers for bulk order requirements as it can\n          reduce the overall payment value of the service (s).</span>\n</p>",

        "<p><b>Delivery Time:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Turnaround time or delivery is a priority for translating legal\n          files. Nobody should compromise on the quality and precision of\n          translating legal documents. And so, you must give enough time for the\n          translator to understand, evaluate, and then start working on your\n          legal document. It is hence advisable to give your orders quite long\n          before the requirement. Though it is not possible to pre-order your\n          language requirements for emergency cases, try to pre-order your\n          translation to avoid last-minute hustles. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>You will ultimately reduce the extra cost spent on fast turnaround\n          projects, as well as save the translator from the pressures of\n          translating a document faster!</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Takeaway</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Hire only a professionally reputed document translation agency</span>\n<span>for legal file translation services. Conveying all your language\n          requirements properly to the translator, before starting the project\n          is an unsaid rule.</span>[:]\n      </p>",

In the meanwhile of hunting down the best service provider,\n          it is intriguing to know about the strategies and practises followed\n          by professionals. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>With hands-on-experience and trained language skills, a localization\n          expert will prove websites that are clickable and SEO friendly. Hence,\n          let’s get into the details of the best practises that website\n          localization professionals perform for their customers and clients. By\n          knowing them, it can validate your question on whether hiring and\n          paying for a language expert will be worthy enough of your time and\n          money or not. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>How Expert Linguists &amp; Translators Handle Website\n          Localization?</b>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Let’s start from the basic definition of what website </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\"><span>localization</span></a><span>\n          is all about. When the elements (verbal and graphical) are translated\n          from one language to another, and then gets converted as per the\n          target audience’s culture, then this is termed localization. The\n          translation step leads and then followed by adapting the context of\n          the page to specific target culture. Besides knowledge in the language\n          and web development related aspects, there are many other practices\n          that professionals usually cater to while handling a site localization\n          project;</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Maintaining a Language Glossary:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Glossaries are the index books maintained by </span><a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\"><span>professional translators</span></a><span>\n          and localization linguists. These are vital resources that have\n          specific terminologies and culturally approved words for usage. By\n          having a glossary, the professional can be sure that particular terms\n          used in the translation and localization processes are correct and\n          appropriate to add.  A language glossary is a highly effective\n          collection and is already created with the support of a Language\n          Service Provider (LSP) and the client, thus giving the customer\n          satisfaction in the expected outcome. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Adding the Right Unicode: </b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\"><span>HTML</span></a><span>\n          (hypertext markup language) webpages usually have a multilingual code\n          text that represents the ‘document character set’. And this\n          representation is called the Unicode. A Unicode will assign a specific\n          sequence of bytes for pages and give numbers to each external code or\n          character. Now, the role of a Unicode in localization is that the\n          professional will ensure if the standard Code (s) like UTF-8 are\n          processable with high accuracy. By setting the correct Unicode for a\n          given HTML web page, it will display your website’s elements perfectly\n          in the required target language. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>User Interface Management:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n        Voice-over translation<span>\n          projects do not have visible issues with user interface (UI) since a\n          website’s video and audio elements do not get altered much on an\n          alignment basis. But when it comes to translating and localizing a\n          website, both these processes must separately get a thorough\n          evaluation of the target language’s sentence formation and grammatical\n          nuances. Because, when an English website gets translated to Russian\n          or Indian languages, then the formatting and line alignment will vary.\n          Managing such conditions can be challenging for a newbie and highly\n          impossible for a general audience. Hence, hiring website localization\n          services makes sense. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Local Testing Procedures:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There is no room for errors and displayed bugs with website\n          localization since professionals will surely test your platform by\n          going online locally. With comprehensive testing procedures and other\n          browser authentication methods, your website will be localized as per\n          how your target audience wants the site to be viewed and experienced.\n          Moreover, highly qualified professionals will also test your site for\n          cross resolution checks, where your web page is divided as pixels and\n          examined on a vertical and horizontal basis. It gives a sense of\n          confidence on the website compatibility with any device.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Evaluate SMO:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The process of localization does not end with changing the language\n          and context for the target audience. It continues to the next phase of\n          optimizing your web page for social media. SMO or </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_optimization\"><span>social media optimization</span></a><span>\n          is the second priority for many website localizers to ensure if the\n          site ranks and complies with networking norms. A large population of\n          individuals today open accounts and navigate websites with their\n          social media platforms only. With more number of Facebook, Twitter,\n          and LinkedIn joiners, it is thus crucial to perform SMO for website\n          localization, irrespective of your target audience and\n          language. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Precise Media Localization:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Last but not the least, experienced translators are not only skilful\n          with the linguistic elements of a webpage; they can also perform a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/voice-over-translations.php\"><span>voice-over translation</span></a><span>\n          and culture-focused localization with accuracy. Professionals undergo\n          training programmes before joining an agency as a localizer or\n          translator. This way, they are proficient to do localisation even for\n          audio, video, and other media file formats with high\n          synchronization.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Since localization is a language service that involves both fluency\n          in language skills as well as in the technical web aspects, it is\n          therefore advisable to get things done from an experienced\n          professional only. These experts balance their verbal skills with\n          site-related aspects, proving that your website is localized with\n          relevancy and appropriateness. </span><span></span>[:]\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>India is one of the richest countries in terms of heritage,\n          tradition, culture, and language. Considering the point of language,\n          Indians comprise Bengalis, Kashmiris, Gujaratis, and more divided into\n          the categories of North and South Indians. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>More than 21 diverse languages are spoken, read, and written in\n          India. Accounting to this diversity, the demand for an </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><span>Indian language translation</span></a><span>\n          is growing as technology and innovation grow. Business sectors are on\n          the edge to give users/customers/clients what they need from their\n          services and products. For this user satisfaction, every business\n          should cater to provide resources in the language a person\n          understands. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Hence owing to the improving global hub of India, even international\n          sectors require a translation of their documents and media file\n          formats as per the Indian language context. Thus, the following points\n          stress the importance of translating something (document or media)\n          from your native linguistic to an Indian language.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>The Benefits of Investing in Indian Translation Services</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>It is an unarguable fact that hiring language experts from </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span>\n          agencies is the ideal choice instead of doing it by yourself. The\n          reasons are plenty to state: Accuracy, quality, timeline, experience,\n          skills, quality control processes, etc. Now, when investing your cash\n          for Indian language service providers, you are sure to get the\n          following benefits, apart from high quality and precision;</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Reach a Wider Range of Audience:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>As per 2020, about 1,380,004,385 individuals live in India. A high\n          fertility rate leads to more population in India. It is a problem in\n          terms of economy and resource sharing. Yet, this factor is a benefit\n          for business sectors. By delivering products and services in the\n          language that Indians understand, your business may have 1,380,004,385\n          new people besides other country populations. So, owing to India’s\n          high population, translating elements such as a web page,\n          international commodity, online audio and video channels, OTT\n          streaming platforms, etc. you will cater to a large audience, only\n          from India!</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Manufacturing Hub of India is Growing:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>With new initiatives and business projects coming up, Indian is\n          hiking in specific industries. A few notable ones among them include\n          medical/healthcare, legal services, travel and tourism, information\n          technology, banking and finance, food and beverages, and the list goes\n          on. So, the catch here is if companies outside India are running\n          operations based on any of the mentioned sectors, then it is high-time\n          to get your elements translated from the native lingual to an Indian\n          language. By doing so, the field can gain momentum in terms of higher\n          revenue, better lead generation, more online traffic, increased views\n          and reads, etc.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Technical Translation is Vital:</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Take the domains such as oil and gas, chemical industry, engineering\n          and medical-related fields. Be it a research project or an actual job,\n          the idea here is to draw the attention of people. But a consumer will\n          utilize the idea only when the instructions are\n          legible.  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Say that you are a mechanical technician, and you need the user to\n          understand the guidelines on how to your machine-related app. Now, the\n          user can understand your app only if the language is of their native\n          origin. So, you need to hire a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><b>mobile app translation</b></a>\n<span>agency to change the language as per user convenience. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Thus, it is clear that translating technical documents such as user\n          manuals, guides, instruction booklets, etc. is essential. Moreover, by\n          translation of these documents, you can safeguard many lives and avoid\n          grave health damages!</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>Two of the primary objectives to develop a mobile application is to\n          increase your idea’s visibility and increase the exposure range. These\n          are the core values that are going to help you get better Monthly\n          Active Users (MAU). It eventually leads to generating higher returns\n          and revenue! However, the works to be performed for attracting a wide\n          range of audience is tricky and involves technical experience. For\n          this expertise, people usually go with a reputed </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><span>mobile app translation service</span></a><span> provider to get their requirements done right. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Know that hiring a </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><span>translation agency</span></a><span>\n          solely depends on the end purpose of your application. It means, to\n          reach the target users, you may choose between app translation and app\n          localization. Both sound similar, but there are a few pointers that\n          distinguish each other in terms of the outcome. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The following information can be a useful resource to help you get a\n          clear idea of whether your mobile application needs a translation or a\n          localization service. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h2>\n<b>The Contrasting Features of App Localization and Translation</b>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>Let’s put it straight. The idea of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span>\n          is to change the language of a given document, media file, or book. It\n          has to retain the meaning in the translated version. Here, we refer to\n          the translated language as ‘target’ and the language that is given a\n          translation as the ‘source’. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>For better understanding, consider this example: By translating a\n          movie from French to Korean, we mean that the source language is\n          French and the target language is Korean. </b>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Coming to the point of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\"><span>localization</span></a><span>; this involves the change of language for a given context, but also\n          by imbibing words and captions that are necessary for a given\n          community to understand. The professional here will adhere to the\n          cultural and aesthetic values of the country, people, and other target\n          parameters. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Here is an example: By trying to make your German website reach the\n          audience of Indians, then you will retain the layout and design\n          elements of the site, but change the sentences, words, captions and\n          other minute details, as per the Indian context. </b>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>By translating, you are making sure that the target audience\n          understands what you are trying to convey. But with localization, you\n          are directly interacting with the audience; hence, ensuring that every\n          expression and ethnic factors of the context matches with the\n          end-user.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Now, that we have defined what localization and translation means,\n          you can decide whether to translate or localize your app. Do thorough\n          market research and use analytics tools of your audience and then pick\n          the ideal language service (s). And the best part is, you can invest\n          in doing both app localization and app translation. So, for this\n          particular condition, let’s see the characteristics that must be\n          translated and localized in your app. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h2>\n<b>Localization Plus Translation: Elements You Need to Consider</b>\n</h2>",

But with app localization,\n          the elements have to be translated and modified, based on the cultural\n          background of the user. So, those aspects include:</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li><span>Current units (e.g. $, INR, Renminbi, etc.)</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>Metric measurements (e.g. height, distance, weight, etc. )</span>\n</li>\n<li><span>Format of the Date (ordering the date values)</span></li>\n<li><span>Idioms and expressions </span></li>\n<li><span>Visual graphics and animated pictures </span></li>\n<li><span>Spelling differences (e.g. color or colour)</span></li>\n<li><span>Comprehensible Words (e.g. cookies for biscuits)</span></li>\n</ul>",
        "<h2><b>An Additional Note on Both these Services</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>Whether it is app translation or localization, it is essential to\n          keep in mind that the line spacing and page size are unchangeable. Of\n          course, there are a few languages that are manageable in terms of\n          length. For those cases, hiring an experienced mobile app translation\n          service will be the only option.  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Also, in the stance of providing culturally-acceptable and relevant\n          elements, the app’s final product should respect the ethnicity of your\n          target audience. So, attend to special situations where you are adding\n          humour sense, relationship quotes, social values, religious notions,\n          gender-oriented factors, and similar elements into your\n          application. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Summarizing What We Learnt</b></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>First, understand your target audience and then choose the language\n            service appropriately. It can be app localization or app\n            translation. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>App translation means you change the language of readable elements.\n            App localization converts symbols, figures, pictures, etc. adapting\n            to the culture of the end-user.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>App translation remains neutral to ethnic differences but app\n            localization has specific racial requirements. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>It is advisable to hire experienced international translation\n            services for furnishing the language requirements of your app with\n            precision. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<b>PRO TIP: </b><span>In case, if you are hiring a mobile app translator, make sure that\n          the concerned professional can show results that match your target\n          audience and ethnic community.

However, to become a subtitling expert, it\n          requires a heavy emphasis on language and communication skills. Beyond\n          these two, there are many other aspects that make a subtitle\n          translator standalone from the rest. Following below is the detailed\n          coverage on the expertise, skills needed, and personality traits of\n          subtitle transaction experts. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>The Fundamental Job of a Subtitler</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>Subtitler is the designation given to someone who is into the work of\n          adding translated captions (subtitles) for videos. Subtitlers are\n          needed for media-related requirements such as movies, NetFlix, iTunes,\n          Amazon Prime, YouTube, and even social media (SM) videos. Also,\n          reputed </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/voice-over-translations.php\"><span>voice-over translation services</span></a><span> hire subtitlers for their in-house projects.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span></span><span>Note that the word ‘subtitler’ applies for both manual (human\n          processed subtitling) and automated (machine-generated subtitles). So,\n          to be more precise, let’s use the term translators or subtitle\n          translators in this entire context. Hence, the primary role of a\n          subtitle translating professional is to change the language of a\n          video’s subtitles with precision and quality. Retaining the overall\n          meaning of the translated version is an unsaid rule. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>To avoid confusion, let’s also define transcription. Transcription is\n          the process of converting media file formats (audio and video) into\n          text (physical copies). The one who does this procedure is called a\n          transcriber. People usually get confused with the terms ‘transcriber’\n          and ‘subtitler’ since both work with video and language conversions.\n          Still, there is a major difference in the process of how a service is\n          undertaken. As an added value, experienced transcribers are also asked\n          to translate the final transcript, depending on the purpose!</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>The 2 Modes of Doing Subtitle Translation </b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>We now know what a subtitle translator does. However, the process of\n          doing a subtitle translation can be possibly done in two different way\n          as given below;</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Interlingual</b><span>: The first step is to transcribe the video. Then he or she will\n            translate the content in the required target language and put the\n            written words as subtitles below the video’s display. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Intralingual</b><span>: Similar to interlingual, but the translation step is not\n            undertaken here. Meaning, first a video is transcribed and then the\n            readable format (transcript) is uploaded directly within the video\n            as subtitles. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>So, whether someone needs a translated copy or not has to be\n          instructed to the concerned subtitling expert beforehand. This also\n          gives us the direct interpretation that all subtitles are not\n          necessarily translated. But it also does not mean that the overall\n          procedure is simple! The following description states how challenging\n          the job of a subtitle translator is.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2>\n<b>The Intricacies Present in Subtitling and Translation </b>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>First and foremost rule of translation (and subtitling) is to retain\n          the original meaning of the context in the target language. Following\n          this, accuracy also comes into play. Usually, experienced\n          professionals manage to achieve a precision of about 98% in the\n          project.  Besides these, a subtitle translator should also:</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li><span>Spell the words correctly</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>Understand the source and target language’s dialects and\n            nuances.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Must focus on displaying the subtitle for quite some time to avoid\n            pressurizing the viewer to read fast. </span>\n</li>\n<li><span>Be proficient in grammar. </span></li>\n<li>\n<span>Check if the phrases or words included do not have any\n            cultural-sensitivity issues. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>Subtitle and its translation is hence a critical process and involves\n          specific personality traits. And these traits are the keys, which help\n          the professional to understand the audience’s language barrier!</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2>\n<b>A Professional Subtitle Translator has these 2 Personality Traits</b>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>The following three qualities can help identify a novice from a\n          language specialist. They are also the traits that usually voice-over\n          translation services expect from interview candidates. </span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Time Management</b><span>: When beginners try to translate the subtitles within the time\n            limit, professionals tend to submit the project quite soon before\n            the deadline. </span><b>Subtitle translation</b><span>\n            also demands an expert to be punctual at his/her work station, and\n            this is a significant point when it comes to live-broadcasting\n            services. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Language Expertise: </b><span>Communication and language go hand-in-hand. Subtitling translators\n            cannot compromise on their language, communication, presentation,\n            and writing skills. With higher knowledge on these aspects, the\n            person will give coherent subtitles and translated\n            copies. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>The success of a language professional can finally be noted when a\n          hearing-disabled person or a non-native individual understands the\n          <strong>subtitle</strong> and the\n          <strong>translation</strong>! </span>[:]\n      </p>",

It is because they will get your video content popped on </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page\"><span>SERPs</span></a><span>. However, reaching geographies such as Panama, India, Australia,\n          Japan, can be hard since your video’s language is not similar to\n          theirs. Hence, whether you rank in those countries is also quite a\n          question. But by adding subtitles, you are going to get more views,\n          SEO ranking, and also attract viewers globally. </span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n<span>Of course, voice-over has its advantages, but in comparison to\n          subtitles, the latter is better. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Translating and subtitling videos from one language and target\n          audience to another is a tricky procedure!

It can be a\n          book, website, medical record, or even a manuscript.

So, you should ideally give the\n          project to a professional language service provider.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>However, before understanding the importance of hiring an agency, we\n          will first look at a few points on why you must not translate files on\n          your own. </span>\n</p>",
        "<h2>\n<b>Here are 3 Reasons Why You Should Not Translate By Yourself</b>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>Imagine that you require a translation from French to Japanese. Now,\n          you might be bilingual with excellent verbal knowledge in both the\n          languages. Yet, you cannot deliver a translation because of three\n          reasons as given below;</span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>You will not be completely aware of the nuances in French and\n            Japanese. A Nuance represents the original meaning of a specific\n            word and the associated internal feeling with it. Even considering\n            only one country, Nuances will change across cities. Hence you\n            cannot translate files without learning all the nuances.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>In the case of education and academic-related language services,\n            the concerned university/authority will ask for the official\n            signature of the translator. So, if you are translating the academic\n            content and signing it by yourself, then this is illegal. It will\n            lead to privacy concerns. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>The translation process is not constrained to changing the language\n            alone. The person must first translate, check errors, edit\n            superfluous words, and proofread with language glossaries. And the\n            most crucial part is that the entire document, when translated from\n            one language to another, must retain the original meaning. So,\n            translation is a time-consuming process, provided if you do it by\n            yourself. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>Concerning these factors, hiring a language agency is the only way to\n          get correct results. The discussed aspects are not only for Japanese\n          or French; they apply to any language reference. Still, if you think\n          that your translation is possible with an online tool or software,\n          then the following values have to be noted.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>Human Translation Surpasses Automated Tools </b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>First, let us define what human and automated translation modes\n          are. </span>\n</p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Human translation refers to changing the language of a given format\n            using skills and training by a linguist. Human and Manual\n            translation both mean the same. </span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>When a technology-based software does the translation service, then\n            it is called automated translation. Professionals use the term </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\"><span>Machine translation</span></a><span> to represent digital language service.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Now, coming back to the topic of translation mode, machines are\n            programmed and controlled by humans. At present, nearly all the\n            automated tools and online software sites work based on Machine\n            Learning (ML). Known for its growing technology, ML has years to\n            develop and perform correctly. So, relying on automated translations\n            at this time will likely give you absurd results. </span>\n</li>\n</ul>",
        "<p>\n<span>On the contrary side, experienced individuals handle human\n          translation services. They know the nuances, dialects, accents,\n          pronunciations, and other language-based demographics with high\n          precision. Thus, giving translation projects from a reputed online\n          agency is recommended. If you are unaware of how to find the best\n          agency, then the following points will guide you.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>How to Hire the Right Translation Service Provider?</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>Now, you might interpret that human translation requires experience,\n          vast knowledge of the language aspects, and relevant on-field\n          training. But besides these, there are some more standards that you\n          should evaluate before hiring one. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span></span><b>98% Precision</b><span>\n          – The agency must promise translation results with 98% and above\n          accuracy. Never pick companies lower than this value. 98% is the\n          average level of precision that an experienced linguist will prove\n          from the translation.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Native Linguists </b><span>– Hire only professionals who are native language experts from their\n          country. As every translation takes account of both the contextual and\n          cultural factors, only native linguists are aware of\n          both.  </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span></span><b>Language Compliance</b><span>\n          – Hiring agencies that support 75 to 100 languages is advisable. A\n          majority of the service providers today have compliance with 100+\n          languages, including rare ones such as Cree, Dari, Oromo, etc.\n          Choosing such multilingual companies gives a hold on the\n          results.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<strong>NDA –</strong> The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) must be signed\n        by translators from the hiring agency. You can check the NDA option from\n        the company’s features section. For official and legal translation\n        services, NDA is mandatory to guarantee confidentiality and data\n        security.<b><span> </span></b>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Hence, whether the need is an English book translation project or\n          Chinese </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations.php\"><span>subtitle translation services</span></a><span>, going with reputed companies is the best option. Make sure to\n          notify the hired service provider about any language customizations,\n          if required.</span>\n</p>",

        "<p>\n        [:en]Books are being read by many for various reasons. Some read to\n        relax, some to gain knowledge and others to pass the time peacefully.\n        Thus, there is a large percentage of people who love to read books.\n        While many of them do not prefer ebooks because they need the smell of\n        pages, turns of the pages, and aesthetic of the cover, there is still a\n        considerable increase in the number of people turning to ebooks. With\n        this popularity of ebooks comes the role of translation ebooks.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        So,\n        <span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/e-book-translations.php\"><u>ebook translation</u></a></span> services hold significance for the ebook authors and ebook\n        readers.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Now before we proceed to discuss the benefits of ebooks translation\n        services, let us have a look at some more reasons to prefer ebooks than\n        the books.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Too many books on a single device</b></strong>– With ebooks, you can load as many books as you want as an e-reader.\n        It is especially beneficial for travelers, commuters, students, and\n        anyone who has this habit of reading anywhere. It also saves space at\n        home.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Easily accessible</b></strong>– You can easily approach the ebooks as they are available on the\n        internet. Anyone can download ebooks and material online instead of\n        going to a bookstore.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Environment-friendly</b></strong>– ebooks are environment-friendly. They eliminate the requirement of\n        the paper printing process, saving a lot for the publishers.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>\n<strong><u><b>Why ebook translation?</b></u></strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Without a doubt,\n        <span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><u>translation services </u></a></span>have opened up numerous opportunities in every field. So it is in the\n        ebook translation. Getting the ebooks translated inspires us to test our\n        own literature and widen the audience group. On the same note, there are\n        various advantages of using the ebook translation services.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Increased sales</b></strong>– Readers all across the globe can download and read the ebooks. Hence,\n        by downloading your ebook in their native language, the audience can\n        connect to it easily and read your creations. This will consequently\n        lead to increased sales of the ebook.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Lesser competition</b></strong>– The competition gets minimized when the book for the popular niches\n        is published in different languages. If the book is well-written and has\n        relatable ideas, it can withstand the huge competition and will gain an\n        additional benefit with the\n        <span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><u>translation</u></a></span> services. After you have made it understandable, the one quality\n        required is that it should be able to engage the readers till the last\n        page, and then it will face less competition.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>More reach</b></strong>– Availing professional ebook translation<strong><b> </b></strong>services will present your book in front of millions of viewers. This\n        enhances your image as an author even in a foreign land, making you\n        popular worldwide. More people search you on social media leading to\n        increased fan following. On the other hand, by publishing it in a single\n        language, you limit yourself and have a limited reach.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Easy ranking</b></strong>– lesser competition, ranking becomes easy. Some additional efforts\n        will include searching for the popular keywords in the targeted language\n        and culture and optimizing your content with its use.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Increased engagement</b></strong>-Bilingual books have more chances to be read. The friendly language\n        translated by manual translation creates an attachment with it and\n        puts the readers in a comfort zone.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>\n<strong><u><b>Finding the right translation agency</b></u></strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n        Once you are well aware of the reasons to use the translation services\n        and the types of translation, it’s the right time to get the ebook\n        specialist.

Let’s have a\n        look at both –\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>A freelance translator-</b></strong> A translator must not only know both the languages but also be\n        fluent with the use. Freelance translators are trained for their tasks,\n        and they are a great budget-friendly choice.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        The only thing is you may have to spend some more time at work with him.\n        You will have to express all the demands, feedback: objectives, and\n        costs directly and in detail. However, having the right freelancer at\n        work may ease the path for you.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Translation services agency-</b></strong> Most of the people prefer working with agencies. These services\n        have experienced and skilled translators at work, and you don’t need to\n        worry about that.

        "<p>\n        Even though you are supposed to discuss the details of the budget,\n        deadlines, and objectives of the project but with the services not\n        directly with the translator. Services will have certain policies, so\n        you don’t have much to discuss.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Ebook translation is the best way to take your creation to the world,\n        and the<strong><b> </b></strong>manual translation service makes an additional benefit. Now,\n        whichever method you choose for the ebook translation, make sure the\n        final output is perfect as you wanted.

Even if they manage to do these translations internally, they\n        have to suffer most of the time, either due to inefficiency or the\n        consumption of time. So, hiring some professional translation services\n        matters, and you must look at the benefits:\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>High-quality work</b></strong>– Employing the staff who knows some versatile languages may seem to be\n        the viable option, but it’s not enough. You may not get the satisfying\n        accuracy without the\n        <span><a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\"><u>professional translators</u></a></span> because there is a massive difference in just understanding two\n        languages and qualifying as a translator. Moreover, the translation\n        agencies revise the translated content several times, reducing the risk\n        of misinterpretation of the information.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Specialization</b></strong>– You might need translations involving technical terms many times. In\n        that case, you can only rely upon some trusted specialists who have\n        immense experience in the field. The professional translators will have\n        to consult with the experts in the area then, like the lawyers, doctors,\n        IT experts, etc.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Speed of the translation</b></strong>– Now, the staff performing the tasks internally do not present you the\n        job at the same rate as the professional translators. In such a\n        situation assigning the task to the internal team may lead to missing\n        deadlines and making mistakes. The consequences of this mistake depend\n        upon the type of business and may sometimes cause blunders.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Consistency-</b></strong> An essential aspect of a successful business is consistent\n        communication.If one loses that with his employees or with the people in\n        seniority, it may create a big mess at the workplace and may invite\n        various losses. Thus, with one\n        <span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><u>translation</u></a></span> company, they know the type of work you want and will make the\n        best efforts to get you that. Whereas if you carry on the job with the\n        internal translators and lose them someday, you will have to get someone\n        else with similar skills.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        These are the benefits of a professional International\n        translation services company, but you must also note several\n        reasons that will compel you to use the translation services.\n      </p>",
        "<h2>\n<strong><u><b>Let us have a look on few of those-</b></u></strong>\n</h2>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Leads to the growth of the company</b></strong>– When you aspire to trade into the international market, you need to\n        use various documents in that particular nation’s language. To make it\n        feasible at that instance, you have no other option than to translate\n        the existing papers into the desired language. Thus, translation\n        facilitates the medium of trade and makes business boundless.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Manage the social media</b></strong>– The use of social media and other platforms for the branding of the\n        business has become necessary today. But what if the audience is not\n        familiar with the language you use? The content can be easily translated\n        into the familiar one by making a trusted<strong><b> </b></strong>International translation agency at work.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Attracting foreign audience</b></strong>– Presenting the products and services in a familiar language can act\n        as a big reason for the overseas audience choosing you over others. When\n        you are modifying your content and the website in their language, you\n        are also accepting their culture. This is taken as a positive gesture by\n        the potential audience.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n<strong><b>Even law demands translation</b></strong>– The certain thing is that you have to present some information and\n        documents to the government of the targeted country in their native\n        language. The information may differ from one country to another, but\n        the requirement of the trusted International translation services\n        prevails.\n      </p>",

        "<p>\n        Any mistake in a translated document can pose severe consequences for\n        the businesses. It may even lead to the damaged reputation of the\n        company.

Thus, you must\n        always look for a reliable\n        <span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/\"><u>translation agency</u></a></span> that has the desired quality in their work.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Well, there are multiple factors in selecting the right people for work.\n        The process starts with thorough research about the companies in the\n        vicinity and checks their services. Make sure they have worked in the\n        niche you want them to do. Then you can personally contact them and talk\n        on the phone for more precise details.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        A clear discussion about the work, the length of the work, niche,\n        category, etc., will help the agency to decide their ability. Another\n        important aspect is whether they perform software translation or manual\n        translation. It’s better you opt for a<strong><b> </b></strong>manual\n        <span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/document-translations.php\"><u>document translation</u></a></span> service as this reduces the chances of error and keeps you away\n        from the blunders.\n      </p>",
        "<p>\n        Price can be the least factor in the decision, though, but if you have\n        similar qualities of the work at the same rates, it can act as a\n        decisive factor. Thus, use the above information to make the right\n        decision and facilitate the expansion of the business in the\n        international market.\n      </p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>\n        [:en]<span>It feels great to finish a video project that you have dreamt of for\n          a long time—what a moment it is when you finally feel that you are\n          done with something worth presenting. But then you suddenly realize\n          that there’s something still left to be done because you want it to be\n          seen by more and more people. It doesn’t matter if your customers know\n          the language you have recorded the video in; their friends whom\n          they’ll share the video might not, and for them, it needs to be\n          translated.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>There are two popular ways to make your video understandable;\n          voice-over translation and the subtitle translation. Choosing one\n          between both can be a bit challenging. So, you need to know at least a\n          few important aspects about both so as to make the right decision,\n          whether you should pick a voice-over translation agency or avail a </span><b>subtitle translation</b><span>\n          service. Moreover, keeping sufficient information about them will also\n          assist you in choosing the right agency.</span>\n</p>",
        "<h2><b>Subtitle translation explained</b></h2>",
        "<p>\n<span>In the subtitled video, the audience listens to the original\n          language, and the dialogues in the translated language appear at the\n          bottom of the screen. So, the viewers enjoy the original inflections\n          and tone of the video and get the genuine experience.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>The use and limitations of subtitling</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The written translations are kept at most of two lines and are made\n          to appear in sync with the audio. So, the same thing poses a challenge\n          for the subtitlers. The length of the line, the time to read them, and\n          then syncing with the audio make their job difficult.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Also, in many languages, the length of the line increases after the\n          translation, so it can’t be covered in the short window of just a few\n          seconds. Here, the subtitler has to adapt to the changed length\n          without compromising with the actual meaning of the content, which\n          becomes a problem many times. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>However, the professionals at the established </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations.php\"><b>subtitle translation</b></a>\n<span>agencies very well know how to deal with it. They manage to prepare\n          it anyway by dropping the unnecessary repetition and filler words.\n          They sometimes even restructure the complete sentence keeping the\n          meaning the same with the original content and cutting out the\n          irrelevant piece of information. Now, this act of restructuring may\n          face criticism by some people who want not even a single edit with the\n          actual dialogue.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Sometimes, even after the professional translation, the subtitles can\n          be distracting to the viewer, especially when the video carries a\n          strong visual message. In that case, choosing a well-skilled </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/voice-over-translations.php\"><b>voice-over translation</b></a><span> service will be a better option.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><span> </span><b>Advantages</b><span>– </span></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>The key advantage of using subtitle </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\"><span>translation</span></a><span>\n          is that it is cheaper than the voice-over. The costs associated are\n          less because subtitling requires no voice talent, audio studio, or the\n          recording engineer. Furthermore, it has become a great method of\n          presenting the video to the people across the globe through platforms\n          such as YouTube.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><span></span><b>Voice-over Translation</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>A </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over\"><span>voice-over</span></a><span>\n          translation needs to be done in an audio studio with voice-over\n          talent. It is recorded in the target language from the translated\n          version of the original script. So, the viewer gets to watch the video\n          in their native language. Like the subtitling, the translator here\n          also needs to adapt to the complexity of both the languages and has to\n          be careful about the syncing of the audio with the video.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>How many people prefer to avail the </span><b>voice-over translation</b><span>\n          services against the subtitles because the former has no distracting\n          text on the bottom of the screen. Instead, they can have the video in\n          their language without missing any visuals. In addition to this,\n          having more than one voice’s talents to distinguish multiple speakers\n          gives the required clarity.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>How to choose</b></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Both the methods of video translation are effective and can be used\n          without any doubt. But the suitability depends upon a few\n          factors-</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Type of content</b><span>: It may be a technical video, a corporate video, training series,\n          instructional video, etc. Choose the translation method accordingly.\n          If it’s a promotional video, voice-over will be a better option.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Publishing platform</b><span>: Different platforms have different conditions. A few allow the\n          addition of multiple languages at reasonable prices, whereas others\n          don’t.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>The complexity of the video</b><span>: This is an important factor as some videos already have texts and\n          graphics on the screen, and more subtitling can make it\n          text-heavy.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<b>Target audience</b><span>: Finally, you will have to analyze whom you are actually targeting.\n          Keep yourself at their place and then wonder what will be easier to\n          make the video understandable and authentic.</span>\n</p>",
        "<p><b>Conclusion</b><span>–</span></p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Gone is the days when the artists and the business people had a\n          limited audience, and they could do nothing about this. But after the\n          invention of the translation services, it has become a different\n          story. You need not limit your video content due to some language\n          barriers. </span>\n</p>",
        "<p>\n<span>Put some efforts, choose the right method, get to a reputed\n          voice-over or </span><b>subtitles translation</b><span> agency, and make the difference.</span>\n</p>",

Moreover, translation adds effectiveness to the strategies formulated for the digital media campaign. Thus multilingualism cannot be ignored and has to be owned with grace.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>No business exists without an effective digital media strategy, and content, of course, is a significant part. Now, this content needs to be understood so that the user can decipher the true meaning and look forward to making the purchase. On the other hand, if you have a great website or publisher, but the content is in a foreign language, it is of no use. Here comes the role of a well-skilled </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/media-translations.php\"><b>media translation </b></a>company<b> </b><span>that will efficiently provide you the translated content and add value to the media content.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Benefits of media translation</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Swing and realizing the importance of good content about the company on the internet, one can not belittle the power of media translation as it is the tool to make it valuable. There are so many benefits of this tool. Have a look at the few-</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Adds value to the brand</b><span>– When you enter a new market where a different language, culture, and tradition prevails, a smooth trade becomes a challenge. Any misinformation in such a situation causes disastrous consequences for the reputation of the company. This can also destroy the brand value of the company, and customers may not trust you again.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Through translation, you can make sure that each information is conveyed in compliance with the original documents. With a skilled and reliable </span><b>media translation </b><span>company, you can ensure no <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics\">linguistic</a> errors and accurate information.</span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><b>Leaves positive influence upon the customers</b><span>– Preparing and posting the right content demands immense time, efforts, and money. Translation services will not let that all go waste by turning it multilingual. It also helps to enhance the engagement of the users and create a positive influence on them with their native dialect.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Makes the domestic presence-</b><span> When you offer the products and services in the native language, you come to one step higher than others. Plus, you make someplace amongst the domestic players and give the customers a suitable choice. Undoubtedly, When more people know you, more will connect with you and further make the purchase, thus adding revenue. </span></p>",
        "<p><b>Keep them updated</b><span>– Media content includes everything from the blogs to press releases. Thus, doing them in a known language will help the audience stay updated with the new launches. This fills them with excitement and satisfaction. That is why to keep up this excitement; you need to get a dedicated </span><b>media translation </b><span>company at work.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Legal translation: an essential component</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Having discussed media translation a lot, some discourse about legal translation also needs to be done because, without the legal documents, one cannot dream of trading in a foreign land. Legal translation includes the conversion of legal documents like contracts, wills, patents, etc. Now, as the legal documents are used later for the legal proceedings, one has to be very careful with its meaning. The meaning must remain the same, even after the translation. For the sake of such complexity, you are suggested to look for only the well-skilled reputed </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\"><b>legal translation </b></a><span>company.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Why does legal translation matter?</b></p>",
        "<p><span>First of all, the legal systems of the countries differ from each other. All the laws and rules of the state are framed and devised in consideration with the cultural attitudes of the citizens and thus customized according to the particular country. Along with this, the legal terminology is quite complicated and vast, with some terms used explicitly in one language but absent in another language. In such cases, the translator will have to search for equivalent terms that will replace the word but adhere to the meaning.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>In legal translation, one has to keep the meaning intact, and thus he has to know both the languages at 0 depth and also has to be informed about the legal terms. One needs to understand that any change in the meaning can even cause huge blunders like amending the punishments for the crime.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Choose the right agency for translation</b></p>",
        "<p><span>By now, you must have gained the importance of meaningful and correct translation. A small mistake in the process can spread misinformation and thus hugely affect the reputation of the company even before it settles in a country. Hence, this is not the field where you should take risks. Instead, finalize the company on whom you can rely. For surety, you need detailed research on the portfolio, their previous work, and the skills and experience of the translators. Also, fix a face-to-face meet up for their clear understanding of the work. Make the best use of the meet and tell them the specific areas where you want their attention.</span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><span>So, whether it is the media translation or the</span><b> legal translation </b><span>services, make sure sure you make the best choice as it will have a considerable impact on your business in the international market.</span></p>",

It has made it possible to talk to people miles away, link to them through the daily feeds on various sites and social media applications. But is there something more significant than this? Well, it’s business through the Internet. We can buy or sell almost anything across the globe and even get feedback. The Internet has made all this possible.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Even after this, what remains a barrier sometimes is the language. Being friendly to only some of the languages bounds you to a limited region or nation. However, the businesses no more want to keep themselves bound within the borders. So, what is helping them cross those? It’s making some advancements and modifications in the existing tools, namely mobile apps and websites. Precisely, website localization and </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/mobile-app-localization.php\"><b>mobile app translation</b></a><span> are the significant steps that let the businesses overcome the language barrier.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Know the basics of website localization</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Website <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\">localization</a> is simply the process of altering the content and functioning of the website so that it becomes audience-friendly. It is not only made language-friendly but also modified in a way it matches the culture of the target audience. Thus, it can be said that it’s not a mere translation but localizing the site entirely according to the new area or country. </span></p>",
        "<p><span>It mainly targets to mold the content to the needs and specifications of the potential target audience in the market and enhances the chances of traffic, eventually helping the brand to gain the trust and credibility of target consumers.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Benefits of website localization</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Increases the chances of market expansion: Ecommerce websites hold the utmost importance in the internet world. These websites are undoubtedly the face of your business and help the users connect with you for further trade. Now, making it multilingual makes it useful to multiple folds by sealing partnerships and transactions with people from other countries.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Boosts online visibility-</b><span>: Aware of the presence of techniques like SEO, but still enhancing online visibility becomes a challenge? Your SEO will all go waste when your content is not understandable. Well, devoted </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><b>Website localization </b></a><span>services make this easy and possible. Without a doubt, the localized website with popular keywords will attract potential customers and give you an edge over the other competitors.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Generates increased revenue</b><span>: If you are not an online seller and consider website localization a waste, you must know that most of the people today prefer to check the product online and only then makes their final choice. So, a website in the known language still makes sense. Notably, the more the visits, the more are the chances of increased revenue.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Hence, if you are still confused about the next step in taking the business globally, it can rightly be hiring skilled </span><b>website localization</b><span> service!</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Mobile app translation services: another vital aspect</b></p>",
        "<p><span>If you think you localize the website and all work done, it’s not. The other significant step is left to be done; mobile app <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\">translation</a>. It is vital to understand that a mobile app is a direct platform wherein you can connect with your customers and interact instantly. It is where you can post all the updates and information regarding the business and receive feedback from them. Thus, it needs to be in a familiar language.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Moreover, mobile apps are very much in use these days and are preferred more than time-taking websites, so ignoring its translation may leave you losing so many potential customers. On the other hand, if you make it user-friendly, you have a higher number of online users engaging with your application.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Therefore, if you aspire to trade internationally, without any more thinking on the ‘why,’ make up your mind to look for a competent</span><b> mobile app translation</b><span> company.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Important factors before choosing the right company</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Whatever the service be, you need to be careful while hiring them. The fact is that the people at work make a considerable difference to the output and eventually to the business. Plus, a decision taken in a hurry can cost you double instead of adding to your bank balance. </span></p>",
        "<p><span>Thus, it is imperative to have a few factors in mind when you make the decision.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Translation method</b><span>– Translation is an essential part of both website localization and mobile app translation. Thus it is necessary to check the translation method the company is using. Is it a manual or software or a mix? </span></p>",
        "<p><b>Conduct of the company-</b><span> The process matters, and that is why you need first to analyze the conduct of the company. Do they carry professionalism and adhere to the deadlines?</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Quality of the output</b><span>– The most important thing is what you get after investing your time, efforts, and money. Thus, check the previous works of the company before you okay them.</span></p>",

        "<p>[:en]<span>Not with standing the notion of unity in diversity, people in India do have an affinity to use their mother tongue in every sphere of life. They like the feel of speaking, reading and writing in their mother tongue. The problem is that the country has an astounding diversity in languages. The country is known in the world not just for its one billion plus population, but also for the range of languages spoken. In fact, there are around 30 languages used on a regular basis in different parts of the country. Though there is a defined official langue in Hindi, there is no national language in the country unlike many other nations. For this reason, there are pockets and areas in the country where the local languages prevail in offices, businesses or other spheres. This is a problem for businesses aiming to have a pan Indian presence. They need to incorporate a feature in their websites whereby the content can be translated to all Indian languages depending on the requirement. </span></p>",

        "<p><span></span><span>Literacy in India may not be at par with developed countries. Yet mobile penetration and adoption of smartphone has given rise to a stupendous demand for content. People have an innate desire to watch videos, listen to songs and read text depicting various shades of life. Different people want different content, but there is one thing that is common to most of them. Almost all Indians just love to watch movies and listen to songs in their mother tongue. Therefore, whether it is a product description, a video, a movie, a story or a website, it evokes an emotional response only when it is written or depicted in the mother tongue. </span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><span>Moreover, it is a fact that barely 10-15% of Indians can understand, speak, read and write English accurately. In fact, there are many who don’t understand the language at all. There are still others who have just a modicum of understanding of the language. For all these people, content in any form, let alone a website, has to be in their mother tongue.</span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><span>Needless to say, businesses have a strong need for localization of their content. To be more precise, people in India would appreciate your website and go through it only when it has a desi flavour. Your website needs to evoke a sense of the mother tongue. Therefore, translating the website in Indian languages is a prerequisite for any business trying to establish a pan Indian presence. </span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><span>A report by the <a href=\"https://main.trai.gov.in/\">Telecom Regulatory Authority of India</a> (TRAI) reveals that millions of Indians have not listed English as their primary language. This is one of the reasons for them having a limited use of mobiles despite possessing smartphones. The problem is the prevalence of English content. There is no denying the fact that most of the content available in the web is in English. Due to this dominance of English language content and scarcity of content in regional languages many people are deprived from enjoying the variety of content that is available in the internet these days. </span></p>",

        "<p><b>Localization of Websites And Apps</b></p>",
        "<p><span>It is not just the government or company websites, but also the e-commerce websites need to be translated to regional languages. Nevertheless, some companies have started localizing their content. They are trying to translate all the data in their websites in the major Indian languages. Needless to say, it is a huge task for any business. However, if you need to target Indian buyers, you need to render the content of your website in the language of the reader. Otherwise, your message will not reach the intended buyer. </span></p>",
        "<p><span></span><b>Problem With Localization Of Content </b></p>",
        "<p><span></span><span>However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization\">localization</a> of content in Indian languages is riddled with complexities. There are many issues, but the major among them are font and localization issues. </span></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li><span>Font issues</span></li>\n</ul>",
        "<p><span>There is a general lack of good quality and accurate fonts for different regional languages in Open Source format. There are several DTP Software like Adobe Illustrator, Corel, Adobe FrameMaker etc which work neither with Unicode font nor with True type fonts. Though the Indian Government has mandated that mobile phones have to offer display in 22 Indian languages, the reality is nowhere near. Moreover, enabling regional language in “settings” of a mobile phone also needs some digital and English literacy. Many Indians lack such a level of literacy. This is defeating the very purpose of offering multilingual support in mobile phones. Moreover, smartphone usage is app driven, And many of these apps are not built to support local languages although the smartphone itself supports the language.</span></p>",
        "<ul>\n<li><span>Localization</span></li>\n</ul>",
        "<p><span>What businesses need is not just translation of webpages, but also creation of original regional language content. The basic job for businesses is to start with translation of websites in all Indian languages. Only by doing this can the businesses that are trying to have a presence all over India can appeal to the emotions of the Indian buyer. However, it should be good quality translation so that the content evokes a local flavor and the Indian buyers get attracted to the product or serviced offered. </span></p>",

      "content": [
        "<p>[:en]<span>The idea of machines taking over humans has become quite prevalent these days. The word that is used to describe it is automation. It does not necessarily mean complete substitution though. It basically implies that humans and machines can work simultaneously, hand in hand. The workload is reduced and productivity is increased. Even in the field of translational firms, both human and machine type exists. Before going into the details about them and finding out which exactly is better, it is important to understand why translation firms are required in the first place. Only when this concept becomes clear, the utilities of it can be discussed more freely.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Business having global approach</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Nowadays, most businesses have a global approach. They do not want to stay limited to a few places and have fewer options in front of them. However, this type of expansion and globalization means their entry into the local market as well. Whenever someone talks about localization, two important aspects come to the forefront, the culture and the language. Both are interrelated in some fronts. The main function of the translation firms is to take up the themes and messages of business and convert them into the local language. This has a different mass appeal to the local people altogether. Moreover, they can capture the potential customer base more effectively as they know specifically what works best for a local community and what doesn’t. </span></p>",
        "<p><img alt=\"Type of Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5682 lazyloaded\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\" data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31-2-1024x538.jpg\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Type of Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5682\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31-2-1024x538.jpg\"/></noscript></p>",
        "<p><span>Another important aspect to keep in mind is the fact that what something might mean in someplace may not be the same in some other. In fact, it can be insulting or derogatory, making matters worse for the business as a whole. A good translation firm ensures that these kinds of debacles are completely avoided and the reputation of the business is intact. The local translation is important from various points of view. For example, if you are creating a website that is specific for a particular place or modifying a product so that it conforms to the specifications of a market, the proper translation is an absolute must. This is especially important for businesses that have a major international clientele and market. They should not shirk away from using the services of </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/international-language-translations.php\"><b>international translation services</b></a><span> at any cost.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Now that the usefulness of a translation firm for a business is well determined, it is important to consider the two different types- human translation and machine translation. On a very basic level, the difference between them is very simple to explain. Human translation involves human manual workers doing the work using their own brainpower while the machine translation is done by machines using artificial intelligence. </span></p>",
        "<p><span>It is not like machine translation has come to the market recently. It has been around for almost 60 years now. Google Translate is the most commonly used machine translation that is used these days which uses Artificial Intelligence appropriately. The best part about it is that it is free which is good for small translation jobs. Its credibility on a huge business scale is questionable. There are other machine translations as well as the Microsoft Translate and the Yandex. Translate. The big question is, which is better?</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Human translation vs Machine translation</b></p>",
        "<p><span>Simply putting it, the work of both the type of translation is the same. They help in the conversion of texts from one language to another, keeping the context in mind. What differs is the characteristic of the translation that they differ. There is a huge difference in opinion in this aspect. Some say that machine translation is extremely accurate while others feel that they add more problems than doing well by inappropriate conversions. Some people pass the judgment that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\">human translation</a> is more reliable and there is nothing that can take its place. There is no unanimity in this answer. </span></p>",
        "<p><img alt=\"Machine vs Human Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5683 lazyloaded\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/21-1-1024x538.jpg\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Machine vs Human Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5683\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/21-1-1024x538.jpg\"/></noscript></p>",
        "<p><span>It is also because of the fact that the actual results are dependent on a number of factors like the language being translated and the region in question. The truth of the matter is that machine translation has gained considerable ground in businesses these days and it looks like it is here to stay. For example, if you consider </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/subtitle-translations.php\"><b>subtitle translation services</b></a><span>, it is mostly done using machines. The translation occurs at a very fast pace, something that human translation generally cannot match. However, with the increase in fluency, the chances of committing errors and wrong translation also increase. Therefore, it looks like a double-edged sword.</span></p>",
        "<p data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\"><span>Now, this raises the next question, where does this leave human translation then? People with a futuristic mindset opine that it will soon become redundant as more and more people will switch to the automatic machine type. The optimistic lot does not agree though. They feel that the credibility of human translation can never lose their value. Maybe it is a good idea to make a human translator cross-check and proof-read the machine-translated texts so that no mistakes are guaranteed. There is also the matter of translation of marketing texts. Sometimes, when a message is being adopted for a particular place, it might need to be changed completely to make it more applicable.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\"> Machine translation</a> is too technical and cannot do that. Thus, in scenarios like these, human translators are still the magnum opus. Someone who is really good with their work can keep their job secure.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Now again this raises a counter-question, why machine translation at all? If the business is not very high on a budget or needs the work to be done instantly, then machine translation suffices. There is no denying the fact that the labor costs will significantly reduce. Another key point, which can work in favor of machine translation, is the reproducibility. There will be some good translators and some bad translators from the human point of view. There result for the same translation might vary, sometimes significantly. Such is not the case with machine translation. The result will be the same every time. </span></p>",
        "<p><img alt=\"Advantages &amp; Accuracy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5684 lazyloaded\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/41-1-1024x538.jpg\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Advantages &amp; Accuracy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5684\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/41-1-1024x538.jpg\"/></noscript></p>",
        "<p><b>No clear insight to the prospect</b></p>",
        "<p><span>What is the answer then? Which is better? Which can be scraped? There is no clear cut answer here. Though machine translation is evolving at a rapid pace, it has not established itself completely as being completely accurate. It does need to be checked and edited by some humans for accuracy. Though it is pretty close to being as good as translation can get, there are some limitations that are not fulfilled and might be under the capacity of human translation only. Therefore, if you want the best results, it is always better to compile the services of both accordingly. There is no need to make a choice when you can get the best of both worlds for amazing results. If budget is your main concern, you may get inclined towards machine translation more. However, if you look at the bigger picture, if some disaster takes place, you have to spend a lot more to compensate for it. Thus, your choice should be a very conscious one.</span></p>",
        "<p><span>Now that you know about machine translation and human translation in detail, it is probably a good idea to judge the pros and cons of it and come to a decision that will be best for your business.<br/>\n</span>[:]</p>",

It is expected that this population will rise to 666.4 million by the end of 2023. India has shown its potential to become the world’s 2</span><span>nd</span><span data-wpmeteor-wheel=\"true\"> largest population in terms of internet users. It is a huge market for online businesses and portals to grab. Most of the states, rural, and urban users prefer Hindi as a common language and find it easier to connect with a website catering to knowledge in the same language. This is where the hidden potential of a website portal lies. Using Hindi translation services for websites will prove to be one of the best resources for online businesses and portals in the upcoming decade.</span></p>",
        "<p><b>Grabbing the potential </b></p>",
        "<p><span>English is considered to be the official communication language by most of the countries. This is why a global website portal uses it to convey its messages. The current trend of penetrating a global market has adopted a local outlook to reach better to the users. A global presence is now defined in a localized format where a business can approach a local audience by omitting the language barrier and creating a proper communication channel. </span><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/website-localization.php\"><b>Website localization services </b></a><span>have become a priority for global websites. In fact, the indigenous online presence is also opting for translation services to cater to the local audiences in Hindi. </span></p>",
        "<p><span>A survey, done by the UN’s International Telecommunication Union, suggests that nearly 28% of global internet users are adept at understanding content in English. The rest struggles to get hold of the content shared by a website. Hence, seeking a translation service for websites will be ideal for online ventures to connect well with potential leads and generate good business by providing better solutions. </span></p>",

        "<p><b>Why choose Hindi for your website localization?</b></p>",
        "<p><span>As mentioned earlier, English is the 4</span><span>th</span><span> most spoken language in the entire world. In India, this percentage is much less than the global level. In fact, Hindi acquires the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> position in the world as the most spoken language after Mandarin Chinese. Hence, it can be easily understood why Hindi can be the best bet for your website translation process. </span></p>",
        "<p><span>These days, a business cannot operate or stand as a worthy option when it does not have a website to cater to its products/services. The brands targeting a huge market in India must go for a Hindi translation service to hold a good position in the market. After all, when it comes to communication, language is the priority. As the number of internet users is increasing every day, Hindi will become the top priority for a business to make its website more connectable.</span></p>",

Globalization, in all aspects, is the order of the day. However, when you go from one place to another, you cannot keep the same approach throughout. Customer preference and requirements vary from place to place. It is important to look at the business with a new perspective so that the local people from a particular area are appropriately targeted.</p>",
        "<p>One very important entity in this aspect is the kind of language that is spoken. Although English is considered to be a global language, the appealing factor is less when compared to the regional language spoken in an area. Even if you take different places in Europe itself, even though English is prevalent, businesses with local propaganda will gain more impetus in the market. It is not possible to be fluent in all languages in the world. It is an even worse tactic to try and translate on your own. The chances of it being a debacle are quite ripe. There is no need to worry though. Nowadays, the services of translation firms are available quite conveniently. They are specialized in thinking from a business point of view when performing translational procedures. On appointing the correct firm for the above-said purposes you can penetrate the local market effectively. This measure is also guaranteed to give you success in many aspects.</p>",
        "<p><img alt=\"Translation Workflow\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5655\" data-lazy-src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/32-1024x538.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Translation Workflow\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5655\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/32-1024x538.jpg\"/></noscript></p>",
        "<p>There is a catch though. How do you know which translation firm is best suited for your business? It is all the more confusing because of the number of options available these days. It is bound to cost money and adequate resources along with time. You will also have to ensure that the firm you employ provides <b><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/legal-translations.php\">legal translation services</a>. </b>Therefore, how do you make the correct decision? There are some features that you need to consider. They have been discussed in detail below.</p>",
        "<p><b>Factor 1- Are the translations done by a human or a machine?</b></p>",
        "<p>Although automation is a recent trend, it is not a good idea to introduce it everywhere. It is applicable in translation firm business as well. Therefore, the first thing you be checked is who does the translation? Is it a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\">human translator</a> or a machine? The problem with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation\">machine translation</a> is that it takes each word and translates it into the local language, without keeping any context in mind. When a human translator is present, he or she understands what the company is trying to convey through a message. They will also be in a position to know if some words or phrases are unacceptable or offensive in some places and then either eliminate or reframe it. Your chances of angering the local people unknowingly will be minimal when the firm has a human translator at their disposal. Thus, cultural differences are taken into proper account here.</p>",
        "<p><b>Factor 2- What is the industry that they specialize in?</b></p>",
        "<p>Different industries have different linguistic requirements. When you look at any business organization, there will be some specialized terms that will apply only to a particular industry. It might mean nothing or something opposite to someone else. Therefore, you need to find out what type of industry the firm specializes in. Suppose the firm chosen does not comply with your company, chances are high that the translation will sound artificial. If it does sound artificial, it will not appeal to the audience. You have to assume the fact that the common public is smart and cannot be easily fooled. Therefore, the accuracy of the translation is a very important factor to be considered. This is especially important when your industry is on the technical side, like being related to the medical or engineering field. Words and phrases play an important role here and can actually make or break the reputation of the company. Therefore, choose one with a solid experience in the same and you will have one less headache to deal with.</p>",

        "<p><b>Factor 3- What kind of experience they have in the past?</b></p>",
        "<p>One thing that you look at when hiring someone for a job is the past experience they have. This theory is applicable to hiring a translation firm as well. Yes, freshers should be given their due chance but someone who has a good hold of the work is always better. There are some minute intricacies that are present with respect to translation. To the common man, it may not sound very significant. However, the one with experience will have a knack to figure out any discrepancies that might be missed otherwise. Moreover, someone with past experience will know the positive side as well as the negative aspects of different types of translation. Since they have prior knowledge, they will be able to make an informed judgment in an even better manner. There is one more factor that is to be considered here. Translation done by firms with good past experience will have good credibility. You might not need to even get it proof-checked by your in-house staff. Thus, it saves a lot of time and the use of human resources.</p>",
        "<p><b>Factor 4- How much time do they take to complete a work?</b></p>",
        "<p>There is a very famous saying that time is money and it is really applicable in any field of business. Sometimes the requirement of the work is such that it needs to be done immediately. The firm should have a reputation to be capable of dealing with such situations. Even in general, they should be able to meet deadlines and not delay their translation job. There have been scenarios where a delay of a day or two has led to a company facing losses worth millions. Different types of translation jobs have different numbers of steps. For example, for <b><a href=\"https://devnagri.com/e-book-translations.php\">eBook translation services</a>, </b>proofreading as well as improving the copies becomes extremely crucial. The firm should plan accordingly so that they can still meet deadlines. The business organization and the translation firm should build a good rapport so that the need to be on time and the urgency is properly comprehended.</p>",
        "<p><img alt=\"Benefits of Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5657\" data-lazy-src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/42-1024x538.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"538\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20538'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1024\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Benefits of Translation\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5657\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://devnagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/42-1024x538.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></noscript></p>",
        "<p><b>Factor 5- Are they specialized in transcreation as much as a translation?</b></p>",
        "<p>Just being able to translate may not be enough in some cases. Like mentioned before, certain terms and phrases may have different meanings in different local areas. A very good example of the disaster that may be caused by it is the translation done for the tagline of KFC in China. After translation, the ‘finger-licking good’ became ‘ Eat your fingers off ‘ which completely changed the perspective of the sentence. A good translation firm would take the nuances into consideration and work. Having a sound knowledge of the different cultural innuendos of a local place is extremely important. Only the best translation firms give enough importance to transcreation as well as translation. Therefore, while making your choice, you should ensure that the translation firm has a reputation for it.</p>",
        "<p>It must have become clear by now that when you choose a translation firm, a sound knowledge of the local language and culture is imperative. Therefore, do your research well and make your choice only if they fulfill all the above-mentioned factors adequately.[:]</p>",

        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\">Voice Over translation is better than subtitles in many ways. When a viewer is watching video content with subtitles he has to continuously keep up with the words appearing in the screen. In the course of doing so, the view often misses out on other details like the body language of the performers, information which is intended to be communicated visually, background details, etc. </span></p>",
        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\">When a person comes across new information that is to be understood visually particularly in learning modules, it gets quite hard to comprehend what is being taught without the assistance of visual clues in the video clip. Similarly, voice-over translation makes sure that the audience listens to uninterrupted complements what they observe. </span></p>",
        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\">Reading subtitles often becomes tricky because translation expands the sentence unnecessarily and communicates the wrong ideas to the viewers. Based on the language of the subtitles of the video content translation it makes the screen appear text-heavy and many times it does not fit the screen. A lager part of the learning course comprises of technical terms and another content-specific language which leads to further expansion or contraction of the text up to 40%. It has been observed that words on the screen do not maintain the same pace as the video content which makes it difficult to understand the sense of the footage being shown. It communicates the wrong mood and tone since the viewer is unable to relate the words with the clip appearing on the screen. </span></p>",
        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Voice-Over translation stands out over Transcripts</b></span></p>",
        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\">The value voice-over translation versus transcripts can be clearly understood during instances like e-Learning. Watch a clip in one language and reading in a different language simultaneously is not very comfortable. It gets even worse when one has to deal with information overload. Many of the instructions have not yet realized the value of voice-over translation. Most of them publish theory videos in English and add transcripts written in another language. Readers and viewers find it challenging to use a transcript while watching a video in a different language. </span></p>",
        "<p align=\"justify\"><span size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: medium;\">Students have to primarily depend upon assumptions and guesswork because it is very difficult to grasp the tone and determine the spacing between words by the use of a transcript. By employing voice-over translation facilities companies can provide training and other e-Learning services in a multilingual format with authenticity and nativity. Translation ensures that the content and its intended use are preserved it is most helpful for learners as they can easily perceive new ideas in a much more comfortable way.</span></p>",

When voice over contents is produced in a studio environment the team entrusted with the task has access to professional tools. Postproduction also has a number of steps which include cleaning of audio files, loudness control, range compression and more. Fine-tuning the difference between loud and soft audio and tweaking other details by post-production processing allows us to achieve the top-quality sound. </span></p>",

        "<p><span>Website<a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/website-translation-services/\"> translation services</a> are being catered by many vendors in India, this has been majorly trending from past two three years due to the bending of the rules to serve the customers in their own language. Now, due to the rise in demand there has been quite a soar in number of the vendors providing lingual services. Devnagri is revolutionizing the way language industry use to work to make things better for the clients.<br/>\n</span><br/>\n<span>While getting the services a lot of hidden cost may get involved by local vendors or freelancers which may turn to be a nightmare in long terms. With no central price and planning the pricing and budget allocation becomes fuzzy. This makes the vendors extract non-linear profits from the client and make the market bumpy for others. Money being the pain point for the clients must be taken into consideration before proposing the plans, but this practice seems to be fading away. So, what all are the tricky sets which curbs and draw differences in offered and billed costings? Some of these are mentioned further.<br/>\n</span></p>",
        "<p> </p>",
        "<ul>\n<li>Exclusive Language Combination<br/>\nThere are many language combinations that are hard to find. This is due to the rare use or the distance that has to be mapped through another language. Involvement of another language as a bridge affects the final cost as the two jobs are being marked internally. This is a very precise case where the modulation in final pricing is made.</li>\n<li>Amount of Data<br/>\nThe usual standard persist that the small content or irregular content cost more as compared to regular bulk content. The cost of engagement of the professional involved gets changed due to which this is makes a major mark. The experienced professionals are costly to higher and if it is for a really short term then an exclusive time can cost even more. Project life cycle of a translation and then proofread can only be down if it exist in the long run along with bulk requirement.</li>\n<li>Nature of Content<br/>\nThis is another major impact maker with which the companies can increase the cost. Finding the subject matter expert with the proven vernacular strength is very hard. And finding a bunch of those can even be more complicated as well as expensive. Thus the cost of the lingual transformation can change to a much spikes.</li>\n<li>Tools &amp; Platform<br/>\nTools and platforms to accept different file formats and return with the same formatting. Or a way to show the real time progress, such tools cost the industry and thus they attach hidden charges to balance this pricing. This is the way in which the cost is added without even the clarification to the customer.</li>\n</ul>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation is not an easy task, it takes layered process of understanding the complicated structure and hidden meaning of all the words placed carefully. This means that the responsible translator needs to understand and adopt the flavor of writing and convert the data accordingly without damaging the essence and flow of the matter. This involves a hardcore professional knowledgeable person and reponsible team to complete the quality task within the committed time duration. </span></p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No doubt that there are a lot of freelancers available online and offline to translate the required data, but the feasibility of their on time completion of work with the quality output is a big question. How to check their quality, experience and on time commitment? How to check the inprogress work? What file format to be given and text formatting challenge resolution is another complicacy. Such questions and worries matter when you have a professional work to be completed. Freelancers are no doubt  a good option but in a structured and formal process. </span></p>",
        "<p><strong>How <a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/international-language-translation-service/\">International Language Translation Services</a> Are Being Catered At Devnagri?</strong></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Devnagri, we take care of all the hurdles that can come in the successful completion of the translation work. All the tensions between a translator and client are resolved with a unique solution providing platform that is Devnagri an AI powered Human Translation Platform. Here are the few things that are important and are catered effectively by Devnagri:</span></p>",
        "<p><strong>Accepting Different File formats:</strong></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accepting different kind of file formats is a basic task that a platform must do to filter the content portion and remove the complicated code or other irrelevant information from the content part. This means that the translator will only look at the core work he is required to do.</span></p>",
        "<p><strong>Glossary For Translators:</strong></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Client can give the work not to be translated or which need transliteration in glossary. This means that those words will be locked and will not change at the time of the translation. This takes away the human error that could project at the time of conversion of the data.</span></p>",
        "<p><strong>Real Time Track of Work in Progress:</strong></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real time work progress is shown to all relevant parties online so that anyone could observe the exact time of completion of the project and could define the future operations accordingly.

        "<p>देवनागरी को एआई संचालित मानव अनुवाद मंच के रूप में विकसित किया गया था, जिसमें काम के माहौल को सुविधाजनक बनाने और अनुवादित सामग्री को समय पर डेलिवर करने के लिए “कुटुम्ब” के नाम से अनुवादकों का एक आंतरिक समुदाय है। कुटुम्भ पहला भारतीय ऑनलाइन अनुवादक समुदाय है, जिसने देवनागरी के साथ मिलकर अनुवादकों की दक्षता में सुधार किया है। अनुवाद बाज़ार को उपहार के रूप में सभी ने क्या दिया है, इस पर आगे चर्चा की जा रही है:</p>",

        "<p>[:en]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-book translation service is the fastest method to get more audience for the publication. This service has been used by most of the known writers, authors and book publishers to make the content interesting for the public. Book being a source of knowledge or entertainment, always gets mang readers. Earlier hard copies were the only approach that readers could use to access the knowledge and entertainment in any topic, but, with the growth of technology and innovation of internet the e-books kicked in and got a huge customer base. </span></p>",
        "<p><b>Introduction of E-Book Translation Services</b></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the internet can be resourceful and handy, it has been filled with content, shaped or unorganized. Opportunists saw this branch and one thing led to another. After the uploading of the e-books publishers and writers got a huge fan following. They brought the service to mainframe shaping it from a blog to community where the readers could have the access on different books and thus e-libraries. There was still a gap which made people unaware about the different kinds of options to read in a particular stream. Now, since there approach was not limited with any geographical boundary over the internet then why to limit the access with language barrier thus, E-book translation came into existence.</span></p>",

This means that the user can easily email or transfer the book virtually, then what else is the issue in translation service of books? Books are in multi-bundle, if it is given to a single expert then it takes a lot of time and accuracy is at risk. Whereas if it given to a company then they might not give it in proper format or machine translation may not be reliable. These may become hurdles to get the desired result.

        "<p>प्रकाशन के लिए अधिक दर्शकों को प्राप्त करने के लिए ई-बुक अनुवाद सेवा सबसे तेज़ विधि है। इस सेवा का अधिकांश उपयोग प्रसिद्ध लेखकों, साहित्यकारों और पुस्तक प्रकाशकों द्वारा विषयवस्तु को पाठकगणों के लिए उत्तम बनाने के लिए किया गया है। पुस्तक ज्ञान या मनोरंजन का स्रोत होने के नाते, अधिकांश पाठकगण पढ़ते हैं। पहले हार्ड कॉपी ही एकमात्र तरीका था जिसे पाठक किसी भी विषय में ज्ञान और मनोरंजन का उपयोग करने के लिए उपयोग कर सकते थे, लेकिन प्रौद्योगिकी और इंटरनेट के नवाचार के विकास के साथ ई-बुक का चलन प्रारम्भ हुआ और इसे एक बड़ा ग्राहक आधार प्राप्त हुआ।</p>",
        "<p>ई-बुक अनुवाद सेवाओं का परिचय</p>",
        "<p>चूंकि इंटरनेट आसान और महत्त्वपूर्ण संसाधन है, लेकिन यह सामग्री इंटरनेट पर  अव्यवस्थिति या असंगठित रूप से भरी हुई है। अवसरवादियों ने इस ओर ध्यान दिया और एक वस्तु ने दूसरी को जन्म दिया। ई-बुक्स के अपलोड होने के बाद प्रकाशकों और लेखकों को बहुत बड़ी फैन फॉलोइंग मिली। वे इसके माध्यम से  सेवा को एक ब्लॉग से समुदाय में आकार देने के लिए मुख्य धारा में लाये, जहां पाठकों की पहुंच विभिन्न पुस्तकों और ई-लाइब्रेरी तक हो सकती है। अभी भी एक खाई थी जो लोगों को एक विशेष स्ट्रीम में पढ़ने के लिए विभिन्न प्रकार के विकल्पों के बारे में अनजान बनाती थी। अब, चूंकि इंटरनेट पर किसी भी भौगोलिक सीमा के साथ दृष्टिकोण सीमित नहीं था, इसलिए भाषा अवरोध के साथ पहुंच को सीमित क्यों किया जाए, इसलिए ई-बुक अनुवाद का चलन प्रारम्भ हुआ।</p>",
        "<p>इस बात का इतिहास गवाह है कि पहले से ही साहित्य का अनुवाद करने के लिए बहुत से तरीकों का इस्तेमाल किया गया था। इसके कई कारण हैं जैसेकि सांस्कृति ज्ञान साझा करना, चिकित्सा पद्धतियों में मदद करना आदि। विभिन्न भाषाओं से शब्द सीखने के लिए हमेशा शब्दकोश और त्वरित मार्गदर्शिकाएँ होती थीं। यहाँ पर इसे एक अन्य माध्यम ई-बुक अनुवाद सेवाओं के रूप में एक नया आकार दिया गया है जहां विभिन्न पृष्ठभूमि के विशेषज्ञ डाटा का अनुवाद करके इसे आभासी समुदायों के लिए अधिक उपयोगी बनाने में मदद करते हैं।</p>",

        "<p>प्राचीन काल से ही अनुवादक विभिन्न समुदायों को ज्ञान सीखने और साझा करने में मदद कर रहे थे। इंटरनेट एक ऐसा विकास है जहां अनुवादकों को दृष्टिकोण संबंधी व्यापक बनाने और सुविधा का उपयोग करने के लिए लोगों को सुविधा देने के लिए सौ प्रतिशत की आवश्यकता होती है। वस्तुतः एक स्थान पर होने से बहुत कुछ किया जा सकता है, लेकिन कुटुम्ब का उद्देश्य विभिन्न स्थानों के विशेषज्ञों को खोजने और उनका उपयोग करने के लिए इस सुविधा की खोज करना है।</p>",
        "<p>कैसे कुटुम्ब अनुवादकों की मदद करता है?</p>",
        "<p>यह एक साधारण समुदाय है जहां विचारक इकट्ठा होते हैं और अपने ज्ञान को साझा करते हैं। जबकि इस चक्र में देवनागरी पर अपलोड की गई परियोजनाओं को इस समुदाय में अनुवादकों को काम करने और कमाने के लिए अवसर प्रदान दिया जाता है। इससे अनुवादकों के लिए बाजार में परियोजनाओं के लिए खोज करने या आय के माध्यमिक स्रोत के कोई तनाव के बिना अपना काम करना आसान हो जाता है। चूँकि कुटुम्ब के पास देवनागरी है, जिसमें अनुवाद की परियोजनाएँ देने वाले ग्राहकों की संख्या है, अनुवादकों को किसी भी परियोजना के लिए चिंता करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। इस खंड में तेजी से सेवा के साथ गुणवत्ता कार्य की सराहना की जाती है। सत्यापन के लिए समुदाय के सदस्यों को विभिन्न भाषाओं में उनकी उत्कृष्टता और ज्ञान के लिए भी परीक्षण किया जाता है।</p>",

        "<p>एक से अधिक भाषाओं में बातचीत, पढ़ने और समझने में विशेषज्ञ प्रवीणता का मतलब है कि अलग-अलग भाषाओं के अनुसार द्विभाषी या बहुभाषी वाला व्यक्ति। भाषिक विशेषज्ञता के साथ-साथ विभिन्न क्षेत्रों जैसे ई-कॉमर्स, कानून, यांत्रिकी, इंजीनियरिंग आदि के व्यक्तिपरक ज्ञान व्यक्ति को द्विभाषी पेशेवर विशेषज्ञ बनाते हैं। विभिन्न क्षेत्रों का ज्ञान भारत में ऑनलाइन अनुवाद समाज में जगह पाने में मदद करता है। यह कमाई का अवसर बन जाता है जिसे उपलब्धता के अनुसार पूर्णकालिक या अंशकालिक के रूप में किया जा सकता है।</p>",

        "<p>अब और अब के बाद, प्रत्येक लोग शिक्षा पूरी करने के बाद या वर्तमान विकल्प से स्विच करते समय अवसरों की तलाश करते हैं। अनुवाद एक काम है जिसे कई अन्य लाभों के साथ लगातार कमाई के लिए चुना जा सकता है जैसे:</p>",

        "<p>. काम करने के लिए कोई निश्चित समय नहीं</p>",
        "<p>यह एक ऐसा काम नहीं है जहाँ किसी व्यक्ति को किसी समय कहीं रिपोर्ट करना है, अनुवाद दिलचस्पी पर आधारित है और यह तब किया जाना चाहिए जब एक निर्धारित समय के बजाय एकाग्रता अधिक हो।</p>",

        "<p>यह तो केवल शुरुआत का एक सिरा है, भारत में अनुवादकों की नौकरी के साथ कई और सुविधाएं हैं। इस समाज से जुड़ें और एक विशेषज्ञ बनें जो उन सभी तनावों से मुक्त हो जो नौकरी करते समय सबसे अधिक प्रबल होते हैं।[:]</p>",

        "<p>[:en]Translator is a professional person who converts a message from one language to another keeping its context aligned. The responsibility is quite high as a lot of things can be at stake if a single word goes out of context. But can it be a Full-time opportunity? What can all go wrong? What are the problems? We have tried to answer all such confusions. We hope it will help you to decide about how you want to shape your future.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Hiccups in Becoming a Full-Time Translator</strong><br/>\nTranslation is a job that most people do for part-time. They work in their regular jobs and work as a translator whenever there comes a chance. Some of the most common reasons are:</p>",
        "<p><strong>Continuous Flow of Work</strong><br/>\nBeing a freelancer and not having the medium to commute with a large group of clients result in non-continuous flow of work. Thus, translators could not take it for full time as their daily expenses would not meet the end with undefined gaps in the work. The most important bridge between translators and clients is missing and it is essential to fill the same.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Work Profile</strong><br/>\nAs a freelancer, it becomes difficult to showcase the translation work. No credits are given by the client for the work done. Then a question arises, how to show that you did a particular translation? It is a hard part for those who work without a platform to reveal their work profile.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Payment Security</strong><br/>\nIn freelancing the main problem is payment security. Both parties create trust issues regarding the work and its payment on time. This is an important reason why most of the people avoid to take translation as a full-time profession.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Lack of tools</strong><br/>\nMany translators do not have the proper tools to filter the content out of different format files. They need a client to filter out only message part out of different files for the conversion purpose, which in exchange becomes another complicated task for the client. Thus, both avoid these kinds of situations and do not work collaboratively.</p>",

        "<p><strong>Work Showcase</strong><br/>\nWhenever the translations are accepted and confirmed by the client, the number of words and projects successfully adds to the profile of the translator. This profile carry ratings, reviews and work charts which can be shared on social media platforms. It is a profile that shows a proficiency grade with credits given for the completed tasks.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Payment Security</strong><br/>\nWe ensure that each and every successfully completed &amp; accepted translation done should be paid for. The auto payment credits in the virtual wallet make the payments secured and timely so that translators hard work does not become worthless.</p>",

        "<p>[:en]Bhashantra, an event addressing Indian Languages was organized by FICCI, Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL), Ministry of Electronics and IT, Govt. of India, and Indian Cellular Association (ICA) in New Delhi under the joint sponsorship of Google and <a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/\">Devnagri</a>. The event took place on 30th July 2018 and it had a direct concern about the Indian language usage and its real-time translation for Indic Linguals.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Indian Languages On the Internet:</strong><br/>\nDeveloping world is running forward taking English as its primary mode for human interaction, in such time Indian society might lack with the language. With this consent, the event’s main focus was to increase the data in Indian constitutional languages over the internet. <a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/why-devnagri/\">Devnagri</a> itself is completely focused on Indianizing the internet data and thus we came forward to support it. Digital transformation in India can only happen with the localization of internet data, as per the founder members of Devnagri.</p>",
        "<p><strong>E-Akshayayan:</strong><br/>\nMoving a step ahead the IT ministry introduced E-Akshayayan, a software that can make editing of text printed on scanned documents happen. The software was made free for Indian language users, they can format the text &amp; can keep it in a separate file as well. With such software development initiatives taken by the government, it is expected that in coming days Indian natal speakers could see better information and more data available in their language on the internet.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Kutumbh:</strong><br/>\nNot only does the announcement of E-Akshayayan took the center of the stage but also the stepping of the new <a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\">Indian regional language translator community – KUTUMBH</a> was launched this day by Devnagri. Kutumbh, it is a community for all the Indian language translators who can get better opportunities and can work professionally for full time while just being online. Devnagri being opportunity creator wants Indians to be skilled in dual or different languages and make it their source of income. This community will create a lot of job opportunities for skilled Indians from different technical backgrounds. As there are a lot of companies trying to establish their products in India, they would require language support to spread their message in the hearts of the Indian population, thus Kutumbh comes into play. The community will cater to different language support to translate their message. Using it as Devnagri’s pillar we have combined human and artificial intelligence.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Language Given Power:</strong><br/>\nIt is through such events that our constitutional languages start getting a boost to mix up with technology. As the government initiated the website and information on public domains require to be present in 22 constitutional languages, it became essential for every department such as news, finance etc to serve the people with the <a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/online-translation-services-face-of-modern-business/\">lingual support on digital platforms</a>. This process is time taking but as the coming years will see a high peak on increased Indian native speakers using the internet, the content would be able to suffice their need. They will be able to understand the technology in a better way and the adoption would be easy.</p>",
        "<p>The event was a huge success with the support of directors and principal heads of the noted languages related Indian organizations.

        "<p>इंटरनेट पर भारतीय भाषाएं<br/>\nविकासशील देश मानव सम्प्रेषण के लिए अंग्रेजी को प्राथमिक भाषा के रूप में इस्तेमाल कर  रहे  है, ऐसे समय में भारतीय समाज में भाषा की कमी हो सकती है। इस तथ्य को समझते हुए, कार्यक्रम का मुख्य उद्देश्य इंटरनेट पर भारतीय संवैधानिक भाषाओं की डेटा में वृद्धि करना  था। देवनागरी स्वयं इंटरनेट डेटा को भारतीयकरण करने पर पूरी तरह केंद्रित है और इस प्रकार हम इस अवधारणा का समर्थन करते हुए इसे और आगे बढ़ाना चाहते हैं।देवनागरी के संस्थापक सदस्यों के अनुसार, भारत में डिजिटल परिवर्तन केवल इंटरनेट डेटा के स्थानीयकरण के साथ ही हो सकता है। </p>",
        "<p>ई-अक्षययान:<br/>\nआईटी मंत्रालय ने एक कदम आगे बढ़ते हुए ई-अक्षययान, स्कैन किए गए दस्तावेजों पर मुद्रित टेक्स्ट का संपादन कर सकने वाला एक सॉफ्टवेयर की शुरूआत की। यह सॉफ्टवेयर भारतीय भाषा उपयोगकर्ताओं के लिए मुफ्त में बनाया गया है , वे टेक्स्ट को फॉर्मेट कर सकते हैं तथा इसे एक अलग फ़ाइल में भी रख सकते हैं।सरकार द्वारा उठाए गए इस तरह के सॉफ्टवेयर विकास पहलों के साथ, यह उम्मीद की जा सकती है कि आने वाले दिनों में भारतीय स्थानीय उपयोगकर्ता इंटरनेट पर अपनी भाषा में बेहतर जानकारी और अधिक डेटा उपलब्ध प्राप्त कर सकते हैं।</p>",
        "<p>कुटुंब:<br/>\nइस कार्यक्रम का मुख्य आकर्षण ई-अक्षययान की घोषणा और देवनागरी द्वारा नए भारतीय क्षेत्रीय भाषा अनुवादक समुदाय-कुटुंब का शुभारम्भ था। कुटुंब, सभी भारतीय भाषा अनुवादकों  का एक समुदाय है जहाँ वह बेहतर अवसर प्राप्त कर सकते हैं तथा ऑनलाइन अनुवाद कार्य को फुल टाइम जॉब की तरह कर सकते हैं। देवनागरी भारतीय द्विभाषियों या अलग-अलग भाषाओं में कुशल व्यक्तियों के लिए आय का स्रोत का निर्माता बनना चाहती है। यह समुदाय विभिन्न तकनीकी पृष्ठभूमि के कुशल भारतीयों के लिए व्यापक नौकरी के अवसर पैदा करेगी।चूंकि कई कंपनियां भारत में अपने उत्पादों को स्थापित करने की कोशिश कर रही हैं, इसलिए उन्हें भारतीय लोगों तक अपने  उत्पाद को पहुंचाने के लिए भाषा समर्थन की आवश्यकता होगी, कुटुंब इसमें महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका अदा कर सकता है।समुदाय,अनुवाद करने के लिए अलग-अलग भाषा की आवश्यकताओं को पूरा करेगा। देवनागरी में हमने मानव और कृत्रिम बुद्धि को जोड़ दिया है। </p>",
        "<p>भाषा की शक्ति:<br/>\nइस तरह के आयोजन के माध्यम से हमारी संवैधानिक भाषाओं को प्रौद्योगिकी के साथ मेलजोल स्थापित करने के लिए बढ़ावा मिलना शुरू हो गया है। चूंकि सरकार ने 22 डोमेन संवैधानिक भाषाओं में सार्वजनिक डोमेन पर वेबसाइट और जानकारी शुरू की है, इसलिए डिजिटल प्लेटफार्मों पर भाषाई समर्थन वाले लोगों की सेवा के लिए समाचार, वित्त आदि जैसे प्रत्येक विभाग के लिए यह आवश्यक हो गया। इस प्रक्रिया में समय लग रहा  है, लेकिन आने वाले वर्षों में इंटरनेट का उपयोग करते हुए भारतीय स्थानीय उपयोगकर्ताओं में  तेजी से वृद्धि  हो रही है,  कंटेंट उनकी ज़रूरत को पूरा करने में सक्षम होगी।वे प्रौद्योगिकी को बेहतर तरीके से समझ पाएंगे और उपयोग करने में आसानी होगी। यह कार्यक्रम निदेशकों और भारतीय भाषा से संबंधित भारतीय संगठनों के अध्यक्ष के समर्थन के साथ सफल हुआ था। हमें  निकट भविष्य में ऐसी कई आयोजन को देखने की उम्मीद करते हैं।<br/>\n[:]</p>",

Such products facilitate user with the easy operative mechanism as they can be controlled using the internet. Voice, gesture and similar mechanisms can be implemented to operationalize the product, even some are supported by AI (artificial intelligence) to maintain self-control over the particular area or mechanism.</p>",
        "<p><a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/mobile-app-translation-service/\">IoT Localization</a> is essential because human interaction is an important factor with physical devices and it would be easy if the technology could understand different human languages.</p>",

Industrial internet of things refers to all such tech companies.</p>",
        "<p>The biggest barrier they face right now is the operational languages. How to train the products in different languages? To program read and write facilities in IoT still holds a lot of scope for research. Devnagri is working closely to resolve this issue so that the IoT innovation could get a better shape.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Security With IoT</strong><br/>\nWith coming stream of projects under IoT the security concerns have raised as the implementation requires to be on both hardware and software basis. The data requires a separate security layer to be channelized to a particular device depending upon its physical location and rights. The devices too require a hardware encryption so that it becomes difficult for the hackers to target the same in mass product form. It will able to eliminate the hack on all the devices with same functionality. The ID mismatch will trigger a security measure which can track the faulty command system. The security measures are still in alpha mode and the researchers are working to bridge the gap of hardware and software security in open internet resource.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Scope of Translation</strong><br/>\nFrom minutest daily usable product to heavy machineries, the applications are innumerable and users need the access to these products in their natal languages in order to have 100% satisfaction. Some examples devoted to this age of IoT evolution are air conditioners, smart TV, vending machines, dishwashers, washing machines, cars, drones, trains etc.</p>",
        "<p>It is stated that 20 billion IoT devices will be available by 2020 for the consumer consumption and the complete market will be worth of approx $300 billion (as per Gartner). Its success will largely depend on the consumers and their adoption to the technology. To ease the transition, translation is the primary requirement. The diversified lingual users can turn this line of product into huge success if only they could interact easily. Translation simplifies the interaction and to train the products, the industries would require a huge amount of experts from different fields with multi-lingual proficiency.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Translation ensures:</strong><br/>\n– Product reach to the target market<br/>\n– Enhanced user experience<br/>\n– Appropriate product usage<br/>\n– Reviews of product changes according to its usage in an area</p>",

It is an important step towards women empowerment and towards increasing employment.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Full-Time Engagement:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/\">Translator community in India</a> seems to be engaged for part-time in the translation work. The main reason for this being the gap between the client and the service professional. With Kutumbh we are trying to bridge this space and try to create as many opportunities as possible so that translation can be taken as a full-time profession.</p>",
        "<p>Industries too feel the same gap as they do not get assured the quality in the open source market. Indian regional language translators are low in number and the requirement in coming days is going to increase exponentially. With Kutumbh we try our best to provide quality and continuous service.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Women Empowerment:</strong><br/>\nOur community aims to engage homemakers, it is scientifically proven that the women are better bilinguals then men and we want to ensure that this fact would become beneficial for them. With an elasticity to work from anywhere, anytime the members can work at their own pace and need not feel any work pressure or regulation of office culture, quality work is the only expectation.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Skill Improvement:</strong><br/>\nThe community is a place where people work together and solve each other’s issues as well, same implies here. Kutumbh gives an initial place where the skill set on Indian Constitutional language can be improved with the support of fellow experts. The translator can put the query regarding any issue related to the technical terms and solution will come from within the community, thus a translator to translator bond will become stronger. It is a part of grooming exercise which the members can gain profit from.</p>",
        "<p>There are many literate experts that already have<a href=\"https://kutumbh.devnagri.com/register\"> joined the platform</a> and mentorship is one of their expertise domain which in the future will help the young generation to follow the trend. We ensure that this chain remains flowing by injecting some terms that help to increase the vocabulary of every individual joining us.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Try Different Languages:</strong><br/>\nAs this Indian translator community does not barge anyone to be within a specific group of linguals, it becomes a place where a lot can be learned about different regional language. With our community translators from twenty-two, Indian constitutional language backgrounds are connected, this is an opportunity for the natal enthusiast to meet and groom their interest.</p>",
        "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/devnagri-the-indian-translator-for-bets-translation-services-in-india/\">Platform Increases Translation Speed</a>:</strong><br/>\nWhile translation it has been observed that the tools used make the conversion time delayed, not much had been done till now as in technology wise to help the translator increase their speed. Working with ancient technology is holding them back in reaching their true potential. With Kutumbh the latest tech set helps to cut down the effort time and improve the resultant conversion rate.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Files and Formats:</strong><br/>\nNot each translator is tech-savvy in the field of software, hence it becomes difficult to read different file formats and understand the exact message. It becomes difficult for the client as well to filter the data for conversion and thus the project hangs with tech gaps. This gap is ramped up by providing a platform that accepts files from different formats (eg; android files, iOS files, etc) and give the translator only required info, thus hecticness to filter the actual content is taken care off with the technology brought up by us. There are many other platform functionalities which will be discussed in coming blogs.</p>",
        "<p><strong>What More for Translators?</strong><br/>\nIt is not just translation that we help with, the review is another aspect and it helps in earning as well. For the experts delivering the quality content consistently we have developed another level of promotion that is a reviewer. The translator observed distinguishably phenomenon in his work is offered to work as a reviewer and observe or comment on the work of the fellow members. This ensures that the client gets the best quality delivered and the reviewer gets paid while investing minimum time.</p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">चूंकि यह भारतीय अनुवादक समुदाय किसी को भी भाषा के विशिष्ट समूह के साथ रहने के लिए बाध्य नहीं करता है, यह एक ऐसा स्थान है जहां विभिन्न क्षेत्रीय भाषाओं से जुड़ा सकता है।हमारा समुदाय अनुवादकों को 22 भारतीय संवै धानिक भाषा पृष्ठभूमि के अनुवादकों से जुड़ने का मौका देता है, यह स्थानीय भाषा के अनुवादकों को यह एक अवसर देता है तथा उनकी रुचि को बढ़ाता है। </span></p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">अनुवाद के दौरान यह देखा गया है कि अबतक उपयोग किए गए टूल्स अनुवाद कार्य में देरी करते हैं, लेकिन तकनीकी रूप से अनुवादक की गति में वृद्धि करने में मदद करने के लिए अब तक उतना कार्य  नहीं किया गया है। पुरानी तकनीक के साथ काम करना उन्हें अपनी वास्तविक क्षमता तक पहुंचने में रोक रहा है। कुटुंब नवीनतम तकनीक सेट की सहायता से अनुवाद कार्य में लगने वाले समय को कम करके परिणामी रूपांतरण दर में सुधार करता है। </span></p>",

        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">प्रत्येक अनुवादक की सॉफ़्टवेयर के क्षेत्र में तकनीकी समझ नहीं होती है, इसलिए अलग-अलग फ़ाइल स्वरूपों को पढ़ना और सटीक टेक्स्ट को समझना मुश्किल हो जाता है। क्लाइंट को अनुवाद के लिए डेटा फ़िल्टर करना मुश्किल हो जाता है और इस प्रकार प्रोजेक्ट तकनीकी समस्या के कारण बाधित होता है। इस अंतर को एक प्लेटफॉर्म के माध्यम से  ठीक किया जाता है जो विभिन्न प्रारूपों (जैसे; एंड्रॉइड फाइल, आईओएस फाइल इत्यादि) से फ़ाइलों को स्वीकार करता है और अनुवादक को केवल आवश्यक टेक्स्ट देता है, इस प्रकार हमारे द्वारा लाई गई तकनीक के माध्यम से वास्तविक टेक्स्ट को फ़िल्टर किया जाता है। आने वाले ब्लॉगों में कई अन्य प्लेटफॉर्म कार्यक्षमताओं पर चर्चा की जायेगी।</span></p>",
        "<p><b>अनुवादकों के लिए और क्या?</b></p>",
        "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">यह केवल अनुवाद में ही सहायता नहीं करता है बल्कि यह आय अर्जित करने में भी मदद करता है।गुणवत्ता सामग्री प्रदान करने वाले विशेषज्ञों के लिए हमने एक और समीक्षक स्तर को भी विकसित किया है।अनुवादक के काम में लगातार गुणवत्ता देखने के बाद हम उसे एक समीक्षक के रूप में काम करने की पेशकश करते हैं। क्लाइंट को समीक्षाकर्ता द्वारा सर्वोत्तम गुणवत्ता प्रदान की जाए और समीक्षाकर्ता को न्यूनतम समय निवेश का भुगतान किया जाता है। भारत दुनिया में विकास  का नेतृत्व कर रहा है, यह महत्वपूर्ण है कि भारत के लोग विविध भाषाओं से जुड़े हुए हैं।कुटुंब एक इनोवेशन है, एक समुदाय है और इसके अलावा एक ऐसा स्थान है जहां अनुवादक एक मंच पर आ सकते हैं।</span>[:]</p>",

        "<p>“एक देश का भविष्य स्थानीय भाषा में निहित है”<br/>\nयह एक ऐसा समय है कि प्रौद्योगिकी के साथ भारतीय भाषाओं के उपयोग के मुद्दे का समाधान  किया जाता है और जब हम इस मुद्दे के गंभीरता के बारे में बात कर रहे हैं, तो हम भारत में भारतीय भाषाओं के उपयोग को स्वीकार करना चाहते हैं।  जैसा कि हम अपनी भाषा का उपयोग करने की जरूरत  के बारे में बात करते हैं, यह हमारे बचपन से पढ़ने, सीखने और बोलने के बाद भी दिखाए गए कम गरिमा को दर्शाता है। यह मामला गहरी चिंता का विषय है क्योंकि यह भारतीय भाषाओं के उत्थान की दिशा में हमारे प्रयासों का मूल्यांकन करता है। सैकड़ों सख्या में होने के बावजूद, क्षेत्रीय भाषाएं आज की तकनीक के दौर में सही जगह खोजने में असफल रही हैं।</p>",
        "<p>भारत की विविधता को परिभाषित करने वाली भारतीय भाषाएं –<br/>\nअलग-अलग भाषाओं में बोलने वाले,भिन्न रीतिरिवाजों को मानाने वालों और अलग-अलग संस्कृतियों में रहने वाले  लोगों को ढूंढने के लिए भारत में एक बहुत ही सामान्य दृष्टि है। मार्क ट्वेन ने एक बार कहा था कि 1600 बोलियों और 22 से अधिक  मान्यता प्राप्त आधिकारिक भाषाओं के साथ “भारत मानव जाति का पालनाहर, मानव बोली का जन्मस्थान, इतिहास की जन्मदात्री , किंवदंती की दादी और परंपरा की परदादी है।” भारत व्यापक विविधता को  परिभाषित करता है। यहां तक ​​कि भारत की मुद्रा भी देश की सांस्कृतिक विविधता को अविश्वसनीय रूप से उच्च मापदंडों का प्रमाण है। यह व्यापक स्पेक्ट्रम निस्संदेह भारतीय भाषाओं से लिया गया है जो “संघ के भीतर, विविधता है” के उदय का प्रतीक है।अब दूरस्थ क्षेत्रों में इंटरनेट सक्षम उपकरणों की गहन उपस्थिति के साथ, भारतीय भाषा इंटरनेट उपयोगकर्ता एक उच्च स्तर का आ गया है। साझा केपीएमजी और गूगल डेटा के अनुसार – </p>",
        "<p>एक ठोस उदाहरण –<br/>\nभारतीय के रूप में, स्थिति यह है कि हम अभी भी भारतीय भाषाओं की अखंडता बनाये हुए हैं। एक सामाजिक जीवन का उदाहरण हमारे सामने है जिसने हमें गर्व महसूस कराया और प्रेरित किया जब हमें एक भारतीय मिला, श्रीमान।भारत प्रताप, फ़ूड ऐप, स्विगी को उनके आवेदन में हिंदी भाषा की अनुपलब्धता पर सवाल उठाते हुए। यहां ट्वीट देखें –</p>",

        "<p>आज की प्रौद्योगिकियों में भारतीय भाषाएं क्यों?<br/>\nयह ऐसा कुछ है जिसे कभी सवाल नहीं किया जाना चाहिए था, लेकिन आज की प्रौद्योगिकियों में भारतीय भाषाओं की काफी कमी है, इसलिए सवाल जंगल की आग की तरह बढ़ रहा है। परिस्थितियां  भी कमजोर हो रही है और यदि गंभीरता से नहीं लिया गया तो यह बहुत हानिकारक हो सकती है।क्यों ? आसान सा जवाब है कुछ वर्ष पहले, हम पानी प्रकृति से  प्राप्त करते थे  लेकिन आज स्थिति इतनी बदल गयी है कि हम इसे खरीदना शुरू कर दिये  है। हां, यह स्थिति बिगड़ने के बाद की थी इसे दूर करने के लिए कदम उठाए गए थे लेकिन हम अब क्यों इंतजार कर रहे हैं जब हम जानते हैं कि स्थानीयकरण व्यवसाय की प्रमुख आवश्यकता है! </p>",
        "<p>यह सच नहीं है कि जिन लोगों ने बचपन से हिंदी या किसी अन्य भारतीय भाषा का अध्ययन किया है, वह अशिक्षित व्यक्ति नहीं है लेकिन अभी भी एकल जीवन जीने के लिए मजबूर है। अंधेरे में जहां आज की तकनीक एक विदेशी भाषा के गोद में बढ़ रही है,व्यापार का यह एकाधिकार बंद होना चाहिए। विशेषज्ञों की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, भारतीय भाषाओं के उपयोगकर्ताओं द्वारा उपयोग की जाने वाली ऑनलाइन सामग्री विभिन्न विकास चालकों के कारण बढ़ रही है – </p>",
        "<p>क्या किया जाना चाहिए?<br/>\nआपकी राय, प्रयास या ज्ञान प्रदान करने के कई तरीके हैं  कि आप इसे कैसे रोक सकते हैं, जैसे भारत प्रताप ने भी किया। उपर्युक्त घटनाओं को प्रोत्साहित किया जाना चाहिए क्योंकि समस्या हमारी भाषाओं के कारण होती है और यदि हम इसके लिए कोई संकेत नहीं दिखा रहे हैं, तो कोई अन्य सेवा प्रदाता या उत्पाद विक्रेता कैसे भारतीय भाषाओं को शामिल करने के बारे में सोचने जा रहा है।लेकिन किसी व्यक्ति से भी ज्यादा, बड़ी और प्रसिद्ध  कंपनियों को यह समझना चाहिए कि यह उनकी संभावित पहुंच की कमी है, ये वे लोग हैं जिन्हे स्थानीयकरण शुरू करना चाहिए।नि:संदेह उपभोक्ता राजा है, लेकिन जब भारतीयों की बात आती है, तो वह भेड़ के झुंड की तरह हो जाते हैं। ऐसा नहीं है कि वे जानते  नहीं हैं लेकिन यह एक परंपरा बन गई है, जो विदेशी भाषाओं में चीजों को ढूंढने और उपयोग करने को प्रतिष्ठा  का प्रतीक मानते  है जो एक कमज़ोरी से कम नहीं है। इसके अलावा, दुनिया भर में ऐतिहासिक घटनाएं हुई हैं, जिन्होंने साबित कर दिया है कि यदि किसी विशेष संस्कृति की भाषाएं और पांडुलिपियों को संरक्षित नहीं किया जाता है, तो वह  विलुप्त हो जाएगी । इससे पहले कि ऐसा कुछ हो  या यहां तक ​​कि कुछ  शुरू हो , अपने सेवा प्रदाताओं से पूछना शुरू करें, अपने विक्रेताओं को उनकी भाषा में उन्हें बेचने और उनकी सेवा करने के लिए कहे । टैग : भारतीय अनुवादक, पेशेवर अनुवादक, अनुवाद एजेंसी, अनुवाद मंच<br/>\n[:pu]</p>",

        "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As we speak about the need to use our languages, it reflects the low dignity we have shown even after reading, learning and speaking them right from our childhood.

        "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is a very common sight in India to find people speaking different languages, following varied customs and living in varying cultures.

This broad spectrum comes undoubtedly derived from Indian languages which signifies the rise of of “Within union, there is diversity.”</p>",

        "<p>The count of towns and villages in India are beyond one’s imagination but they certainly outnumber the cities. It has become a tradition for the start-ups or MNCs or big companies to introduce their technology to metropolitan cities but no one has bothered to take them to tier –II and tier – III cities.

Therefore, the introduction of Devnagri,<a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/devnagri-an-ai-sponsored-translation-tool/\"> an AI-backed translation tool</a> is everything the translation services in India need today.

        "<p><strong>Why Devnagri?</strong></p>",
        "<p>The entire concept of Devnagri rest with making the doc files or web/ app files <strong>multilinguistic</strong> because why not, its India. And not only just multilingualism, Devnagri aims at motivating the developers, businesses and start-ups. The tool is itself a good justification towards making people understand the true meaning of “what happens after you start translating into multiple languages”. Being a free tool, there is no hidden terms and condition with the tool and hence the transparency carried the tool helps in developing as well as maintaining the trust factor.</p>",
        "<p><strong>What happens with Devnagri?</strong></p>",
        "<p>Although, the final crux with India’s first translation tool is to have 100% genuine translations and the constructive infrastructure of the tool is yet another example of impeccable innovation from Indians which honors the diversity of the country as well as its people. With the per-domain translators and reviewers, you never have to worry about the specific words which you have to use in your field of work. Also, there is no need to translate the repetitive words because Artifical Intelligence is intelligent enough to identify the repetitive words and make your translation job an affair of quickness.</p>",

For the past many years, this has been a concern for almost every industry because reaching to customers requires <strong>Localisation</strong> in both, offline and online practices. Yet the industry which specialises in localisation fails to harvest the right elements needed for it.

        "<p><strong>1.25 Billion</strong> powered India is a nation that holds the humongous amount of opportunities for the growth of any potential business. Imagine the evolution anything experiences with time and in a country where there are more than 22 national languages with 1000 native languages, businesses evolution becomes unimaginable. And finding the right audience exposure can become hard if the elements or the ways or practices of Localization aren’t up to the mark. Also, the long-run factor gets advocated because business is all about making and matching of long-term relations with its customers/ audience and with Devnagri, localized content gets served right.</p>",
        "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.devnagri.com/why-devnagri/\">Why we need the system</a> –</strong></p>",
        "<p><strong>“To localize is to act in local”</strong></p>",
        "<p>Localization is importantly the way with which you touch the grounds of languages from a particular region or a culture. It is a process of speaking to the local people of a certain area via your business product or service. This was the reason that didn’t allow many ventures to grow high and taste the success they deserve. Since its nativeness that serves as the basic element of localization and tier – II, tier – III cities are all about the use of local languages, it becomes extremely necessary for businesses to reach there. Understand this simply that who do you wish to target, a small metropolitan audience or the large piece of the cake which comprises of tier – II and tier – III cities or both? The right choice must be made here.</p>",

        "<p>देवनागरी क्या है?<br/>\nदेवनागरी भारतीयों द्वारा विकसित पहली निःशुल्क अनुवाद उपकरण है।वेब ऐप्स और मोबाइल ऐप्स में भारतीय भाषाओं की वास्तविक भावनाओं को प्रस्तुत  करते हुए, यह स्थानीयकरण उपकरण अनुवाद उद्योग के लिए भावी कदम है। आर्टिफिशियल इंटेलिजेंस और मानव प्रयासों की शक्ति के साथ एकीकृत मंच, देवनागरी अद्वितीय है और अनुवाद के क्षेत्र में एक पहला नाम है।</p>",

For the past many years, this has been a concern for almost every industry because reaching to customers requires <strong>Localisation</strong> in both, offline and online practices. Yet the industry which specialises in localisation fails to harvest the right elements needed for it. Hence, it became necessary to endow the translation industry of India with a new system or platform that will help to localise and provide business with reach to next stage audience.</p>",
